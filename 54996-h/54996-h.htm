<span class="medium">AN EXPERT PACKER</span></h2>

<p>“All packed?” inquired Robert Owen, inserting
his head through the door of Number 7
Hale and sweeping the scene of confusion with a
curious glance. Satisfied to accept the evidence
of his eyes in lieu of a definite reply, Owen was
just closing the door again when one of the
Peck twins, who inhabited the room, sang out:
“Hi there, Bobby! Come in here a minute!”</p>

<p>Owen let himself in and set his back against the
door.</p>

<p>“You call that packing, do you?” he asked,
looking with a grin of amusement at a big trunk
which gaped at him with wide-distended jaws,
the whole front of the tray showing like a flaunting
tongue. “Whose trunk is that?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>“Don’s,” replied Duncan.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take some of the things out
and put them in yours?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s going straight home, and I’m
not,” retorted Duncan.</p>

<p>“That lid will never go down,” said Owen,
who had been examining the overfed monster.
“You’ll have to repack.”</p>

<p>“Repack! Why, what’s the matter with that
packing? That wasn’t done the way Blossom
does his&mdash;fill a pillowcase and hammer it down
with a baseball bat&mdash;that’s all hand work.”
He came nearer and whispered in Owen’s ear:
“I don’t want it repacked. I put in a couple
of old bottles that I picked up down back of
Porter’s. There’ll be something doing when
mother unpacks them.”</p>

<p>Donald came out of his bedroom. “Do you
think it will go?” he asked of neither in particular,
gazing doubtfully at the problem.</p>

<p>“Of course it will,” said Duncan, promptly,
“if you put weight enough on it. Try it, Bob,
and see what your hundred and eighty will
do.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span></p>

<p>“Hundred sixty-eight,” corrected Owen, as
he mounted the incline. The lid sank to within
four inches of its proper place.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ve got to take some things
out,” sighed Donald.</p>

<p>“If you take out anything, it will have to be
that box of specimens,” remarked Duncan,
shrewdly. The box of specimens was the one
thing which Donald would not want to leave
behind.</p>

<p>Donald meditated.</p>

<p>“Let’s try to snap it,” proposed Duncan.
“Bob and I will get on one end and jump it
down. You try to catch the fastening when it
comes right. Then when we get one tight,
we’ll down the other.”</p>

<p>This method actually proved effective. Donald
caught the fastening at one end at the fourth
attempt; the weight of all three brought the
second fastening into place. The lid fortunately
was strongly made and the hinges held. Donald
locked the trunk and put the key in his pocket,
while Owen and Duncan pulled the strap to a
hole beyond the power of any porter to loosen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
Then they drew long breaths and contemplated
the work of their hands.</p>

<p>“It’s like a bale of hay,” said Duncan in
triumph. Donald, however, seemed not wholly
satisfied.</p>

<p>“I wish it had iron bands round it. If the
thing bursts, I shall be all to the bad.”</p>

<p>“That strap’s as good as an iron band,” spoke
his twin, reassuringly. “Things go a great deal
better when they’re packed tight; I’ve heard
mother say so often.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go together?” asked Owen,
marvelling that the twins, who belonged together
like the two halves of a walnut, should
actually be at the point of separation.</p>

<p>“That’s a personal question, but I’ll condescend
to answer it,” returned Duncan, a little
sheepishly. “Don, of course, has passed all
his exams. I only got recommended in three,
and I believe I’ve flunked ’em all. So I’m
going down to Uncle Will’s till after the Fourth,
and then I’m to tutor in Cambridge. If I get
a decent number of points in the fall, I’m coming
back here. If I don’t, I’ve got to go to work.”

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Donald caught the fastening at one end at the fourth

<p>“Shall you keep your room?”</p>

<p>Duncan nodded. “It doesn’t cost anything
to do that. They’ve given me a room-mate
too, a tall, bony fellow, named Archer. Upper
middler. Hails from Portland.”</p>

<p>“You’ve seen him, then?”</p>

<p>“No. He’s related to the Sedgwicks, and he
was there the other day. That’s his description
as I got it from Wally. When are you going?”</p>

<p>“To-day. I may as well say good-by.” Owen
held out a hand which Duncan gripped.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you’ll ever be seen here
again,” said the Peck, ruefully. “You’ll have to
come with the freshman teams, though, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“If I can make any,” answered Owen, lightly.</p>

<p>“Make any!” Duncan sniffed. “If you call
that modesty, I don’t. It’s pure affectation.
You know you could make the Varsity nine, if
they’d let freshmen play.”</p>

<p>“I shall come up anyway, whether I play with
the freshmen or not,” pursued Owen, disregarding
Duncan’s flattering comment. “I shall want
to turn up here occasionally to see the old place
and the profs and the people I know.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>“Gee! wouldn’t it be sport when you’re all
through and aren’t afraid of anybody!” exclaimed
Duncan, his tongue hurrying after his
imagination. “I’d walk up to Doc Rounder and
say, ‘How-de-do, Doctor Rounder! How’s that
fine dog of yours?’ Doc would smile all over
and begin to crack the mongrel up. Then I’d
tell him that the pup looked pretty well for such
an old dog, and ask if the police really did shoot
at him for snapping at people. I’d see Hayes
and thank him for all he taught me&mdash;he was
always telling me that I was the only fellow
he’d ever had whom he couldn’t teach anything
to&mdash;and josh him about his chickens. I’d
call on old Moore and get him going about the
school spirit. I’d&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’d better wait till you graduate before
you plan to come back to show yourself off,”
interrupted Owen, laughing.</p>

<p>“That’s a fact,” returned Duncan, suddenly
reduced to humility. “Most likely I shall be
doing the errand-boy stunt in my father’s office.
Don’ll have to be the one to come back.”</p>

<p>“I’m never coming back,” said Don, decidedly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
“I’m down on the place. They’re
always looking for a chance to fire you, and they
haven’t given Dun a fair show. When he’s a
great man, I hope he’ll be elected trustee and
cut down all their salaries.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’d do,” declared Duncan.
“And what I took off from the salaries of the profs
I don’t like I’d give to those who are on the
square.”</p>

<p>“I can guess who’d get an increase,” Owen
remarked.</p>

<p>“Not very hard to do that. I wish you’d guess
how I’m going to get twelve points this summer.”</p>

<p>“Buck up and work, you idiot!” cried Donald,
impatiently.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m going to do, isn’t it?” Duncan
retorted. “I know what I’m up against without
your rubbing it in.”</p>

<p>At this juncture Owen, regardless of the fact
that by staying five minutes longer and using a
little diplomacy he could involve the twins in a
first-class scrap, virtuously said good-by and returned,
somewhat depressed, to his packing.
He liked Duncan Peck too well to hear of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
troubles with unconcern. He hoped sincerely
that the boy would get off a lot of points in September,
and that the new room-mate would prove
to be of the right sort.

<span class="medium">ARCHER RECEIVES</span></h2>

<p>The middle of September was past. The school
authorities had survived the worst of the confusion
of registering, allotting rooms, smothering
complaints, turning away unpromising applicants,
evading the tearful entreaties of parents, arranging
schedules, laying down rules. The second-hand
furniture dealers were sold out, having reaped
a cash harvest of a hundred per cent on goods
bought of the mortally impecunious three months
before. The student dealers in fountain pens
and athletic supplies were making hay in dazzling
sunshine. Football, the great industry of autumn,
clamored for devotees. The first notes of the year-long
wail over the food at Alumni Hall already
floated in the air. With screech of bearings and
groan of ill-fitting machinery, the Seaton mill
had begun its one hundred and twenty-third
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
manufacturing season. Would the product be
worth while? It depended quite as much on the
quality of the raw material provided as on the
process of manufacture.</p>

<p>Sam Archer came to Seaton with vague but
highly colored expectations, due in no small measure
to the entertaining reminiscences of adventure
and romance which his Uncle Fred delighted to
tell. Uncle Fred had preceded him in school by
twenty-odd years. The school had been smaller
then, and the life simpler. The boys still boarded
around the village in private houses, the sports
were general affairs requiring no special training,
the school itself formed a big fraternity with few
distinctions except such as come naturally to
superior personality. Uncle Fred, being a bright,
friendly, whole-souled fellow, learning easily and
possessing a natural aptitude for games of all
kinds, had been a conspicuous figure in the school.
He looked backward upon his Seaton days as the
happiest period of his life; Sam looked forward to
his with an eagerness born of long-fondled hopes.</p>

<p>Sam moved into 7 Hale, to which he had been
assigned, and waited to see what kind of a comrade
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
this appointed room-mate was to be. When two
days went by without sign of a Peck, he called at
the office and learned that the absentee was expected
on the morrow; his coming, however,
depended on the results of the examinations which
he was taking in Cambridge; if he did not appear,
another room-mate would be provided.</p>

<p>Ruminating dolefully on this uncertainty about
a most important matter, Sam reached home in
time to catch a caller who was just turning from
the door. It was Bruce, a good-looking fellow
of the ruling oligarchy&mdash;likewise captain of the
track team. He had been pointed out to Sam on
the first day of school.</p>

<p>“Hello!” called Bruce. “Do you live in this
entry?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Sam, “in Number 7. My
name’s Archer.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re the fellow I’m looking for.
Where’s Duncan Peck?”</p>

<p>Sam opened the door for his caller. “He
hasn’t come yet. I’ve just been to the office to
see about it. They didn’t seem sure that he’d
come at all.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>“I’m awfully afraid that he won’t, myself.
He wrote me that he had to make twelve points
to get back. I don’t believe he can get twelve
points in twelve years.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down?” asked Archer, politely.</p>

<p>“No, I thank you. I’ve got to get home.”
The visitor gave a glance at Sam’s lanky figure.
“&mdash;Do anything in athletics?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” replied Sam, modestly. “I played
football and baseball in the high school, but our
teams wouldn’t be called anything here. I ran
the high hurdles too.”</p>

<p>“Did you?” The track captain’s interest became
keen immediately. “What time have you
made?”</p>

<p>“Nothing very good. Eighteen seconds was my
best.”</p>

<p>Bruce’s eagerness languished. “You ought to
do better than that. If you don’t play football,
get Collins to help you this fall.”</p>

<p>When the next day passed and no Peck appeared,
Sam quietly moved the furniture of the stay-away
to the other bedroom, and took up his quarters
in the corner room, which possessed obvious advantages
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
over its mate. The reasoning here was
as straight as Euclid. This unknown quantity,
Peck, as original occupant, enjoyed a prior claim
to the desirable room. Against all later comers
the Archer claim took precedence. Any claim,
however good, is strengthened by actual occupancy.
If Peck wasn’t coming, Sam might as
well have the room as give it to some one else.</p>

<p>That evening Archer received a call from three
inhabitants of his “well.” They came in boldly,
addressed him jauntily, and proceeded to throw
the sofa pillows at each other and his own surprised
self. Presently one grabbed a baseball bat and
called for a game with the pillows. Another seized
a tennis racquet and began to whack a ball with
indefinite recklessness, but largely at Archer’s
head. When one of the missiles narrowly escaped
the shade of his new lamp, Sam, whose ire had been
rising, waded into the chief offender, threw him
down and beat him hard with the pillow, was pulled
off by another, on whom he immediately turned
with the same vigor, gave cuffs and received them,
and was finally, after a hard struggle, subdued by
the combined efforts of the three. After this the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
trio let him up, shook hands with him, assured him
that he was “all right,” and departed suddenly.
They had hardly time to escape into a room close
at hand, and Sam to pick up his cushions and the
tennis ball, when an ominous knock was heard at
the door, and Mr. Alsop appeared.</p>

<p>“What’s all this noise, Archer?” he began
sharply. “Don’t you understand that no rough-housing
is tolerated in this building?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” panted Sam, non-committal.</p>

<p>“What’s been going on here?”</p>

<p>“I’ve had some visitors.”</p>

<p>Mr. Alsop eyed him sternly. “Who were
they?”</p>

<p>Now this was a very wrong question for Mr.
Alsop to put. If he had possessed half as much
common sense as energy and devotion to supposed
duty, he would never have asked it. He counted
on the newcomer’s inexperience, and hoped to get
a grip on two or three unruly characters in his
well, which would help him in maintaining order
in his territory later on. He did not consider that
in extorting evidence from the new boy he would
be exposing the thoughtless betrayer to months
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
of annoyance and contemptuous treatment at
the hands of the mischief-makers. Fortunately
Archer’s instinct was truer than the instructor’s.</p>

<p>“I don’t know their names,” he said.</p>

<p>“Describe them!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I can, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Alsop threw at the incompetent a glance of
scorn. “Well, you can send them to me.”</p>

<p>Archer’s look glanced from Mr. Alsop’s angry
face to the door of his bedroom, thence to the floor,
thence squarely back again to the teacher.</p>

<p>“I’d rather not, sir.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence. Mr. Alsop
had shot his bolt; he was not prepared to make
an issue of the refusal of a boy to betray his associates.
“You can at least tell them that if this
thing is repeated, you are likely to get into serious
trouble!&mdash;You can do that without offending
your sense of honor, I hope?” he added, with an
accent of sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The teacher turned and retraced his way to his
rooms downstairs. Two doors were pushed quietly
open as he reached a lower floor. From each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
emerged a studious boy holding a finger between
the leaves of a book. The pair crept to the stair
railing, heard the steps descend the last flight,
and a door close. Then they scurried for Archer’s
room.</p>

<p>“What did he say?” demanded the first
eagerly as soon as the door was shut behind him.</p>

<p>Archer began an account of the conversation.</p>

<p>“Did you give us away?” interrupted number
two.</p>

<p>“Wait till I am through, can’t you?” responded
Sam. “No, of course I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Lordie, and let him tell it!” commanded
the other. “We want it all.”</p>

<p>Archer finished his repetition, omitting nothing.</p>

<p>“You’re the right stuff,” declared the one called
Lordie. “Just like the old sneak to try to get it
out of you because you’re new. Last year he got
little Roberts fired for nothing at all. He thinks
he’s the whole institution&mdash;faculty, trustees, and
all.”</p>

<p>The door opened abruptly. Number three
rushed in and closed the door softly behind him.
“Look out! he’s coming again!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>Numbers one and two dived for the bedroom.
Number three settled into a chair and opened an
Anabasis which lay on the top of a pile of books
on the table. There was a gentle tap at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in!” called Archer. Mr. Alsop entered.</p>

<p>“Visitors again so soon?” he asked, seeking to
cover his suspicion with an air of pleasantry.
“You seem to have made friends early, Archer.”
He glanced at the book which lay open on the lap
of number three. “I didn’t know you took Greek,
Taylor.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” answered Taylor. “I just picked the
book up. Looks hard, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is really any harder than a
modern language, if the modern language is
seriously studied. In fact, many teachers are of
the opinion that the college requirement in Greek
is easier than that in German.”</p>

<p>Neither Archer nor Taylor disputed or commented
on this opinion. “Won’t you sit down,
sir?” said Archer, suddenly recalling his obligation
to a guest.</p>

<p>“No, I thank you,” replied Mr. Alsop. “I
returned to speak of something which I ought to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
have emphasized when I was here a few moments
ago. The responsibility for order in the dormitories
is really laid upon the students themselves.
Every student is expected to see to it that no unseemly
disturbance is made, and that nothing is
done to interfere with the studies of others. The
whole matter is left in your hands, and you are
put on your honor to do nothing unworthy of the
dignity and name of the school. It’s in the dormitory
life that the spirit of the school especially
shows itself. We trust you to conduct yourselves
like gentlemen, without being watched, and put
you on your honor to do so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Archer, conscious of a peculiar
feeling, a mixture of approval of the theory
and suspicion as to the practice.</p>

<p>“That is all that I wanted to say. Good night!”</p>

<p>The boys echoed the salutation piously, and the
room was left in momentary quiet. Soon the two
hidden worthies emerged from the bedroom, and
pranced across the floor, chuckling.</p>

<p>“My eye!” cried Lord. “Did you ever hear
such stuff? He puts you on your honor, and then
tries to make you tell who rough-housed you, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
comes sneaking up here to see if he can’t catch
some one. That’s a good one!”</p>

<p>“Just go and tell him something in confidence
and see what would happen!” exclaimed Fowle
(so his name proved to be; his mates called him
“Birdie”). “He’d bring it all up before the
faculty, and you’d be fired like a shot, as Murphy
was last year. That’s <i>his</i> kind of honor.”</p>

<p>“Are they all like that?” asked Archer, in consternation.
He had been taught to respect his
teachers.</p>

<p>“No, only about half,” said Lord. “There are
some I’d be willing to tell anything to, and do
’most anything for. There are others who aren’t
worth wasting cusses on. Alsop thinks he’s the
greatest man since Washington&mdash;and what is
he?” He snapped his fingers contemptuously.</p>

<p>“When’s Peck coming?” demanded Taylor,
abruptly.</p>

<p>“He was due yesterday, if he passed his exams.”</p>

<p>“Too bad if he doesn’t come. He’s an awfully
good fellow and lots of sport. Know him?”</p>

<p>Archer shook his head. Fowle took occasion,
while his friends were intent on this conversation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
to make a good shot at Lord with a sofa pillow.
Lord seized the pillow, but made a wild return.
Fowle jeered. The fracas seemed in a fair way
to begin again when Taylor interfered, and with
forceful prophecies of the fate that would befall
them all if they got to rough-housing again, persuaded
the pair to “quit their fooling” and take
themselves off.</p>

<p>That same afternoon Mr. Peck’s stenographer
brought him a telegram, which ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Got ten points what shall I do send money
quick.”</p>

<p>The father dictated immediately the following
answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Go back to Seaton try again will send check
there.”</p>

<p>The next day Archer saw his room-mate.

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="medium">FIRST IMPRESSIONS</span></h2>

<p>Archer came in from French next morning
feeling depressed. Mr. Alsop had caught him on
an unmastered point in the lesson, and had then
made him the subject of pleasantries which, though
they seemed to the teacher merely casual examples
of his innate cleverness, cut the sensitive boy
to the quick. Of course the boy was foolish to be
sensitive; one of the incidental advantages of the
Seaton system is that while it may develop in the
pupil a precocious sharpness and suspiciousness,
it also accustoms him to hard knocks. Sam,
however, could not avoid the impression that he
was paying the penalty for Mr. Alsop’s defeat of
the evening before. As he felt himself innocent
of wrong-doing, his pride and his sense of justice
were both offended.</p>

<p>He closed the door behind him and let the catch
down; to keep the door locked seemed the easiest
way to avoid trouble. As he turned, he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
startled to see in the doorway of the second
bedroom a coatless lad gazing at him with critical
chilliness.</p>

<p>“Scared of burglars, or is some one after you?”
asked the stranger, scornfully.</p>

<p>“Neither!” retorted Archer. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Peck! I suppose you’re the fellow this wise
faculty has seen fit to tie me up with.”</p>

<p>“I’m Archer,” said Sam, curtly, resenting the
contempt latent in Duncan Peck’s words.</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty name. It’ll look well on a card
on the door. What’s your other name? Reginald?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;Sam.”</p>

<p>“Sam! That’s a come-down after Archer. I’ll
call you Archer; you call me Peck. I’ll take one
side of the room, you the other. You’ve turned
me out of my bedroom, I see.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I thought you weren’t coming. You
can change again if you want to.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t worth the trouble. What do you want
to lock yourself in for?”</p>

<p>“Some fellows came in here last night and raised
a row. I wanted to be let alone.” Sam gave a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
short account of the experiences of the evening
before.</p>

<p>“They won’t try that again now that I’ve got
here,” Peck made complacent answer. “It’s
foolish to get us into trouble with Alsop,” he added,
his tone hardening. “He’ll be down on the
room the whole year. It’ll take a lot of soft soap
to make him feel right again.”</p>

<p>Sam was silent, convicted of having brought
the room into suspicion by unwise conduct, yet
puzzled to see wherein his error lay. He was
disappointed, too, by the coldness and unfriendliness
of this room-mate whom everybody had
described as jolly and agreeable.</p>

<p>Peck put on his coat and went to the door.
“I guess we can get along together if we let each
other alone. Only don’t keep the door locked;
I may sometime want to come in.”</p>

<p>Duncan went his way to the house which his
fraternity made its headquarters, a little ashamed
of his ugliness, but firm in the opinion that this
new Archer was a “fresh guy” who would require
repression to make him endurable. If Duncan
had been forced to give grounds for this dislike,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
he could in honesty have advanced but two. With
the first, Archer was in no way concerned: Duncan
did not want a dormitory room-mate at all;
he wanted to room with his friends of the Alpha
Beta Gamma at Knowles’s. His father, however,
who saw in this scheme but an additional incentive
to waste time, had vetoed it at once, and written
privately to the office to make sure that his son
should receive a “good, quiet, studious room-mate”
who might help him to become in his turn good,
quiet, and studious. By what method of induction
the office arrived at the conclusion that
Samuel Wadsworth Archer was such a boy is not
worth investigation; the office has its whims, and
they are not always wrong.</p>

<p>Duncan’s second objection was personal. In
moving him out of the bedroom which he had
occupied for two years, calmly putting his household
goods on the sidewalk, as it were, and taking
possession, Archer had shown himself to be a fellow
of a consummate and incurable insolence. Duncan
didn’t care for the bedroom,&mdash;at least, so he
assured himself,&mdash;but with a fellow of that stamp
he wouldn’t even condescend to quarrel.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>Duncan did not appear again until just before
his afternoon recitation; the evening also he spent
elsewhere. During the next day he was at home
for hardly two of his waking hours, and during
this time he was either dressing or undressing in
his bedroom, or talking with fellows who came in,
or working at his desk. He was not impolite,
and he spoke pleasantly enough when he found
occasion to speak at all; but he indulged in no
unnecessary conversation and asked no favors,
while his general manner indicated clearly his
purpose that community of room should not
involve community of life.</p>

<p>Sam, though inexperienced, was not wholly
dense. He understood that his room-mate meant
to have nothing to do with him, and at first felt
both humiliated and hurt. But pride soon came
to the rescue. If he was not good enough for
Peck, neither was Peck good enough for him;
he had no reason to be ashamed either of
himself or of his family. If Peck did not want
his society, he certainly could dispense with
the companionship of Peck. This appeal to
pride gave him a certain peace of mind and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
stayed him also against discouragements from
another source.</p>

<p>In his high school Archer had been considered
athletic. He had played on the eleven and on the
nine, and still held the school record in the high
hurdles. At Seaton he found himself judged by
different standards. When he drifted out on the
Seaton campus with twoscore football candidates,
he confessed to himself sadly that he belonged in
the lower third. He possessed too much length
and too little breadth and weight ever to be a
factor in the Seaton games. The only advantage
which he could surely claim over the average impossible
who enlivens the playing fields during
the first fortnight with brand-new trousers and
awkward zeal, was that, being long-legged, he
could kick. The Seaton coaches wanted men
who could kick, but they didn’t want men who
could do nothing else. The best that could come
within Archer’s reach was a place on the second,
or on his class eleven.</p>

<p>The failure to make good in football had been
in a measure anticipated. In the hurdles, however,
Archer had permitted himself certain ambitions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
which, though unexpressed, represented
warmly cherished hopes. Now Collins, the trainer,
who had got him out to display his paces, told him
bluntly that he must learn to sprint before he
could do anything worth while. It wasn’t enough
to pace his distance properly and clear the barriers;
he must mount in better form and get speed into
his three strides between the hurdles. Archer,
being strongly of the opinion that sprinters are
born, not made, took this exhortation as an
adverse judgment,&mdash;especially as it was coupled
with the information that Fairmount’s regular
racing time was a second under his record, while
Kilham of Hillbury was good for at least one-fifth
better.</p>

<p>Sam thought the whole subject over as he sat
alone in his room after dinner on the day of the
experiment with the hurdles. It was clear that
he must accustom himself to an entirely new point
of view. The sooner he was reconciled to being
classed with the mediocrities, the better it would
be for him. Duncan Peck’s conduct indicated
that his personality was not especially taking;
his recitation work was not brilliant, and he suspected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
that his conversation gave no assurance of
great mental gifts; his only hope in athletics was
to plod along the trail after the leaders and pick
up what they might leave. The outlook for distinction
was not promising&mdash;but why must he
win distinction? Was it not better to acknowledge
in all humility the commonplace character of his
endowment, and go cheerfully forward doing his
best all round, and letting results take care of
themselves? He might play football for fun on
the class team; he might take hurdle practice for
exercise and amusement, without hope of silver
cups and gold medals and the sight of his portrait
in the Boston papers. He could certainly meet
Duncan Peck like a polite and self-respecting fellow
who courted nobody’s patronage and understood
a sentiment expressed in manner quite as well as
one voiced in rough words.

<span class="medium">BRUCE GIVES ADVICE</span></h2>

<p>The autumn weeks that slipped by had little
effect on the relations of the two boys in 7 Hale.
Duncan thought less ill of Archer after longer
experience with him: he was not especially fresh
after all; he minded his own business, and did
not presume, or pretend, or brag, or fish for Duncan’s
friends. On the other hand, he was not as
particular in the matter of clothes as Duncan
liked his friends to be. Archer’s coat was not
always fresh from the tailor’s goose, the turn-up
of his trousers was usually imperfect, his neckties
were carelessly chosen, and did not match his
socks. His tastes, moreover, were too democratic;
he showed a disposition to like everybody;
rich or poor, clodhopper or aristocrat, athlete
or grind&mdash;he accepted them all as parts of the
same world with equal rights to favor and friendship.
Archer nodded at every fellow he met;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
so did Duncan, but Duncan’s nods were carefully
graduated to the person. On one fellow he bestowed
a short formal jerk of the head, which,
accurately translated, read, “This is my duty
greeting, even you receive it.” To another the
nod was a conscious expression of friendliness; a
smile that lighted up the face went with this salute,
and a jolly word that had a personal ring. Archer
drew the line at meanness and a dirty shirt; Duncan’s
line was farther up, separating the few who
were supposed to be of the right sort from the
many who were not.</p>

<p>When once the principle was established that
their ways lay apart, it was easier to follow the
diverging paths than to bring them together.
At first Peck thought Archer fresh and ordinary,
and did not care for him. At first Archer was
offended at Peck’s foolish snobbishness, and
proudly disregarded him. The attitudes thus
taken both maintained through obstinacy, after
each had discovered that he was at least partially
wrong. Archer waited for Peck, who had established
the precedent, to change it. With Peck
the loss of the favorite room still rankled, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
he held that advances toward reconciliation should
come from the aggressor. So they tacitly agreed
that they must always disagree.</p>

<p>Bruce came to the door one day demanding
Peck, or information as to where he could be
found. Archer replied in emphatic terms that
he knew nothing about Peck’s affairs.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he ever here?” asked the track captain,
in a tone of vexation.</p>

<p>“Come at midnight and you’ll find him. He’s
here to sleep.”</p>

<p>Bruce looked thoughtfully at Archer. “He
ought to stay at home more,” he said, after a
slight pause. “He won’t do any work, knocking
about from room to room.”</p>

<p>Archer gave an impatient jerk of his shoulders.
“It’s none of my business what he does. I
think he goes away to avoid me.”</p>

<p>“Why should he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He doesn’t like me, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“He and Don used to fight like cat and dog,
but they always stuck to the nest,” Bruce mused.
“What have you done to him?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>“Nothing. He just doesn’t like me. You
can’t blame him for that.”</p>

<p>Bruce had been talking with Collins that
morning, and the trainer had spoken a good
word for the long-legged recruit to the hurdling
force, not on account of what he could do, but
because of the spirit he showed. Bruce was
fond of whimsical Duncan. He was well disposed,
also, to the recruit.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you throw him out of his room?”</p>

<p>Sam flushed uneasily. “Yes, and I offered
to give it back to him. He said it wasn’t worth
the trouble of changing.”</p>

<p>“Duncan is a little queer. He takes things
hard sometimes. The more he feels a thing, the
less he likes to talk about it.”</p>

<p>The visitor departed, leaving Sam to puzzle
over this new light on the actions of his incomprehensible
room-mate. On first impulse he vowed
that if Peck was such a fool that he wouldn’t
say plainly what he wanted, his wants didn’t
deserve consideration. Sam himself, in Peck’s
circumstances, would not have hesitated an
instant; he might have been annoyed, but he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
would have declared his annoyance frankly; he
wouldn’t have played the sorehead. But was
there really any ground for annoyance? Sam
imagined himself in Peck’s place, and answered
immediately “yes.” In fact, the more he considered
it, the more serious the offence became.
A fourth-year boy unceremoniously bundled out
of his old quarters by a newcomer because of
a few days’ delay in arriving, and then calmly
told he might move himself back if he wished!
It was a fresh thing to do; Sam squirmed in his
chair under the lash of his own conscience; however
silly on the part of Peck to pout like a foolish
school-girl, there was no defence for that act.</p>

<p>The recitation bell gave forth its dreary clang;
Peck rushed in, took some books from his desk
and started for the door.</p>

<p>“Bruce has been here,” said Archer.</p>

<p>“I saw him,” replied Peck, as he crossed the
threshold.</p>

<p>This exchange of chilly brevities jarred on
Sam’s perturbed feelings. No one but a lobster
or a sorehead would sulk that way! It would
be of no use to offer apologies to such a fellow.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
The only course was to say nothing and replace
the furniture.</p>

<p>Glad to do something to make amends for his
error, Sam dug out Birdie Fowle from the room
opposite, led him into Number 7, and set forth
his demands. By concentration of will power,
he at length succeeded in giving Birdie’s good-natured
inclination to do anything anybody asked
of him, the victory over his disinclination to do
anything at all. Together they hustled Sam’s
bedroom furniture and general movables into
the study, placed Peck’s bed in the corner room,
moved his bureau without disturbing the articles
on top, and hung his wall ornaments in corresponding
positions in the new quarters. The
contents of his own closet Sam cleared out, but
Peck’s he left unprofaned for the owner himself
to change. After that, the pair dumped Sam’s
possessions miscellaneously in the inferior room,
and adjourned to Porter’s drug store for consolatory
fudges at Archer’s expense.</p>

<p>When Sam returned he found Peck standing
on the threshold of his old room, looking unpleasantly
surprised.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>“What have you been doing now?” he demanded,
as Sam entered the study.</p>

<p>“Birdie and I have just put your things
back in your old room,” answered Archer.
“We did it carefully. I don’t think anything
is hurt. You’ll have to shift your clothes yourself.”</p>

<p>“You take a lot of liberties with other people’s
property!” commented Peck, savagely. “You
seem used to moving. Your family must be
in the habit of changing tenements whenever
rent-day comes round.”</p>

<p>At this slash Sam laughed outright. His
family had inhabited the same house for four
generations. It was one of the recognized ornaments
of the city, pointed out to every stranger.
“The last time we moved was in 1790,” he said
quietly.</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“And I naturally don’t remember much about
it. My great-grandfather did the moving.”</p>

<p>Peck stared for a few silent seconds. “Well,
you’re certainly making up for your ancestors’
omissions. Perhaps they hadn’t anything to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
move. I hope you aren’t going to keep this
thing up all through the year.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry. I shan’t touch your
things again. I’ve just put you back where I
found you. We’re square now.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask you to do it,” persisted Peck,
ill-humoredly.</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t, but I came to the conclusion
that I oughtn’t to have moved you in the
beginning, so I tried to make it good. I’m sorry
if you don’t like it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t care,” replied Peck, with indifference,
going to transfer his clothes to the empty
closet.</p>

<p>Archer strode over to Alumni to luncheon, disappointed
in the outcome of his efforts to make
amends for his act of thoughtlessness. He felt
that he had come as near an apology as he could,
without actually falling on his knees and demanding
forgiveness with tears. If Peck was
still sore, he might go hang! His favor wasn’t
worth having.</p>

<p>That evening Peck inquired what kind of a
house it was that Archer’s family had lived in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
for four generations, and for the first time in
six weeks of co-residence, there occurred between
them what might be called a conversation.
But, as Sam gloomily remarked to himself afterward,
it was like a talk over a wall.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="medium">SPORT FOR SPORT’S SAKE</span></h2>

<p>The football weeks were coming to an end.
With the loss of eight strong players who had
graduated the year before, or for other sufficient
reasons had left school, and the lack of proper
new material with which to work, the coach and
school had been hard put to it to develop an
eleven worthy of Seaton traditions. Sam played
on the second eleven when he got the chance,
and regularly did practice kicking to give exercise
in catching punts to the backs on the first.
He understood well, however, that he was not
of the chosen, and cherished no illusions as to
chance of promotion.</p>

<p>With the best of skill and labor a perfect
finished product cannot be expected from poor
materials. The school, whose pride had been
exalted by the achievements of the Great Year
just past, felt keenly the failure of the eleven
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
to round into proper form. Weak spots, apparently
incurable, developed in the line. The
attack was frequently forceless and scattered,
the defence slow, the whole game perfunctory
and spiritless. Inferior elevens were allowed
to score; teams which Hillbury had found easy,
proved serious foes at Seaton. General sentiment
grew pessimistic as the season advanced.</p>

<p>It was perhaps for this reason that the class
games aroused so great an interest. The juniors
got out their heavy men, inspired them with a
spirit of dash and defiance, and beat the lower
middlers. The seniors drafted four fellows from
the school second eleven, filled up the number
from the squad of brawny candidates, and went
forth to bag the upper middlers. Varney, the
captain of Archer’s class team, took what he
could get from the second eleven,&mdash;three, all told,&mdash;picked
the best of the crowd of ambitious
amateurs, and took up the gage of battle. Sam
found himself, as the only man who could put
the ball back straight, playing at centre, expected
to change places with Bull Norris, the full-back,
when there was occasion for kicking.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>The school team, with the faculty director of
athletics, had gone to Cambridge for a game with
the Harvard freshmen. Some of the teachers
were out of town; others were busy with their
own affairs. Not a soul of them was on the
campus&mdash;a fact which was not at first observed.
An umpire and a referee were chosen from the
two lower classes. The referee, from the defeated
lower middlers, showed himself a model
of fairness; the umpire, a junior, favored the
seniors, whom he considered the weaker team,
hoping that they would survive the fray to meet
his own class. The class supporters took their
places decorously on the side benches, and cheered
their representatives in due and seemly fashion.
Archer kicked the ball to the seniors’ ten-yard
line, where Hoover took it and ran it back fifteen
yards. At this point there was a wrangle over
Fairmount’s illegitimate blocking. The umpire
affirmed at the outset that the performance was
perfectly legal; but on being pressed, took safer
ground for his decision by declaring that he
didn’t see the blocking at all. This aroused a
new spirit. The upper middlers jeered at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
umpire, the seniors jeered at the upper middlers.
In the next scrimmage, Taylor, who was playing
quarter, didn’t receive the ball cleanly from
his centre, and Archer, sprawling his full length
through a narrow hole beside the guard’s knees,
got his hands on the ball and pulled it under his
chin. The squirming layers were stripped off
and Sam was adjudged the rightful holder.
Then the upper middlers pushed Kendrick, their
heavy half-back, through the line again and
again, now behind big Ames, now behind Mulcahy,
the other tackle, now through the centre, until
a touch-down was achieved, and later a goal.
This score temporarily soothed the inflammation
caused by Fairmount’s holding.</p>

<p>The seniors sent the ball down to Mudie, who
fumbled it and was caught on the fifteen-yard
line. Archer now gave up his place to Norris,
who passed back for a kick. The ball came so
high that Sam had to jump for it, but he managed
to get his kick off before Putnam carried him
down. The ball went out of bounds on the
forty-yard line, where the seniors got it. They
had no star like Kendrick, whose playing was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
surprisingly hard and fast, but they worked
well together, and Taylor ran his game cleverly.
Through guard and centre was no thoroughfare,
but the upper middler ends were hugged and
pulled out of the way, without protest from the
short-sighted umpire, and the ball was shoved
down upon the goal line by a series of successful
flank movements, helped out by an occasional
frontal attack on the tackles. So the score was
made even by a senior touch-down and goal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the audience was warming up.
A detachment moved down from the benches
to the side-lines, whither the balance of the interested
sympathizers speedily followed. Regular
cheering ceased. From either side now rose
spontaneous yells of exultation or hoots of disapproval.
The witty indulged in jocose personalities
directed against players of the opposite
camp. The two classes not concerned took
sides, juniors with upper middlers, lower middlers
with seniors. Archer kicked off again to the
seniors’ fifteen-yard line. Taylor tried a quarterback
run, and was nailed on the starting line
and thrown back two yards. The seniors’ kick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
was blocked by Ames, who struck down the arms
of his opponent, and rushing through, took the
rising punt on his chest. From Ames the ball
bounded against the goal-post and rebounded
among the pack. It was found, in time, under an
upper middler’s body. Wildes, the senior left end,
declared that it had been stolen from him, but the
referee would not allow the claim. Then Kendrick
threw himself into several breaches, and plunged,
wriggled, and crawled his way to a touch-down.
Soon after this the half came to an end.</p>

<p>By this time it had become generally known
that not a prof was on the field. A wild spirit
possessed the crowd, a spirit of frolic and horse-play.
Each party wanted victory, but it wanted
fun also, and on the whole more. The ground
was cleared for the second half by volunteer
policemen, who made a great show of eagerness
for order, and in fact led in the disorder. The
crowd toed the side-lines when the seniors kicked
off; when Kendrick got the ball and ran it back,
the throng of upper middlers crossed the lines
and swept in behind the wake of the play. Varney’s
men rushed the ball until they were blocked,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
when Archer kicked. Hoover took the ball
safely for the seniors, and started his team on
a return trip. Immediately another line of
spectators crept up behind the ball, crowding
in upon the game, cutting off the seniors’ crack
end runs and forcing the play directly through
the line. Here the upper middlers held, and
got the ball.</p>

<p>Yet, strange to say, though the upper middlers
now found conditions exactly to their liking, the
line plunges, which had been successful before,
suddenly failed. Every attack that penetrated
the line seemed to meet three men in the secondary
defence. Big Ames glanced over the heads of
his two opponents and yelled: “Referee! referee!
they’re playing thirteen men!”</p>

<p>The line, and the crescent of supporters behind
it, took up the cry. The crescent contracted,
and meeting the line of seniors, enclosed the
players and cut off escape. The two centres
knelt at the ball, gazing at each other through
sweat-dimmed eyes, while the officials counted.
The senior uniforms numbered twelve!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i061" src="images/i061.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“<span class="smcap">Referee! referee! they’re playing thirteen men!</span>”
<i><a href="#Page_44">Page 44</a>.</i></p></div>

<p>Groans and taunts greeted this discovery.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
The senior team was reduced to the normal
number, elbow room was won by the use of
elbows, and the play went on. Two tackles
developed such a mutual interest that they
disregarded the game altogether and devoted
their energies during every scrimmage exclusively
to each other. Each was goaded on by a troop
of ardent backers. The ring of spectators narrowed
and thickened and heaved and sputtered.
Ambitious volunteers sprang in behind and lent
a hand in pushing or in staying the enemy’s
charge. In the increasing confusion, a loud
voice shouted “Game’s over!” In a twinkling
began a stampede for the possession of the ball,
a confused running and pushing and swarming.
The football bladder burst in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e; all
that the outnumbering upper middlers carried
away was the collapsed cover of the much-tormented
ball.</p>

<p>In spite of the assertion of spectators of all
classes that the senior-upper middler game had
been the most enjoyable event of the school
year, Sam was not wholly content to have his
serious efforts turned into a joke. Duncan,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
who was manager of the senior team, likewise
strongly disapproved of the course of things,
and vowed that he should protest the game.
Together they talked it over in the second spontaneous
conversation of the year, in which Peck
took great pains to deny that there had been
any intention of putting twelve men into the
field against eleven.</p>

<p>The next morning the whole school were
treated to a chapel lecture on the extreme impropriety
of their conduct on the field the day
before, and to an exposition of the irreparable
injury caused thereby to the dignity and fair
fame of the institution. At the same time the
game was declared null and void, and command
was issued that it be replayed. The ruling as
to the game the boys accepted as reasonable;
the invective against their rowdyism served but
to sweeten the recollection of an hour when they
had actually enjoyed sport for sport’s sake.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="medium">A BONE OF CONTENTION</span></h2>

<p>The game was played again under prescribed
conditions, and the upper middlers won once
more, this time in consequence of practice gained
in playing together, by good use of the forward
pass, and through Kendrick’s splendid plunges
and fast runs. In fact, Kendrick was easily
the hero of the game. Late in the season as it
was, the coach took him immediately on to the
school eleven as a substitute back, and as luck
would have it, he got his S by slipping into the
unfortunate Hillbury game at the very end.
Of this we shall speak later or not at all. Sam
Archer too, in much less conspicuous fashion,
won credit in the class match, though the senior
centre got under him several times and carried
him off on his back. Big Ames of baseball fame
played with his usual ungainly determination,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
and a fellow named Mulcahy was much in evidence
during the game.</p>

<p>It was on the subject of this Mulcahy that
Archer and Peck came to their first open disagreement.
They naturally talked the game
over that evening&mdash;Sam with frank elation,
Peck in a spirit of good-natured forgiveness.
When Mulcahy’s name was mentioned, Peck’s
attitude changed instantly.</p>

<p>“He’s a mucker!” he said, with contemptuous
curtness.</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded Archer.</p>

<p>“Because he is,” answered Peck. “Anybody
with half an eye can see it. He held Wildes
twice to-day.”</p>

<p>Sam smiled wisely. “If everybody is a mucker
who held in to-day’s game, Mulcahy isn’t the
only fellow in the class. Putnam tripped Ames
deliberately. I saw it myself.”</p>

<p>“It was probably a knee tackle that slipped
down.”</p>

<p>“No, he stuck out his foot and Ames fell over
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s just because he doesn’t know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
the game. No one who is acquainted with Harry
Putnam would charge him with dirty play. If
he did that, it was because he didn’t know any
better, or forgot himself.”</p>

<p>“But if Mulcahy did the same thing, it proves
he’s a mucker!”</p>

<p>Sam was quite satisfied with this rejoinder.
If Duncan Peck had any sense at all, he must
recognize the absurdity of his prejudice. Sam,
at the age of seventeen, with several generations
of locally honored ancestors behind him, had
become, since his arrival at Seaton, an ardent
democrat. He believed firmly that a boy was
as good as his mind and character made him,
without regard to the clothes on his back or the
money in his pocket or the social position of his
nearest relatives. Rebelling instinctively at the
pretensions of certain fellows whose fathers had
“struck it rich,” and whose money gave them a
kind of importance, he was disposed to see in
the poorer fellows who were carrying the burden
of their future on their own unaided shoulders,
examples of a sturdy, manly independence wholly
admirable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>“Whether he did the same thing or not,”
replied Peck, coolly, “Mulcahy is a mucker.”</p>

<p>“The real difference is that Mulcahy works
his way and Putnam doesn’t,” asserted Sam,
warmly.</p>

<p>Duncan smiled scornfully. “The real difference
is that Mulcahy works other people and
Putnam doesn’t!”</p>

<p>“Putnam doesn’t have to,” retorted Sam.</p>

<p>“Neither does Mulcahy.”</p>

<p>“Why, he has to earn every cent he spends,”
returned Sam, eagerly. “It takes a lot more
stuff in you to do that than to wear good clothes
and keep your hands white on the money your
father gives you. It’s these fellows who earn
their way who do things when they get into real
work. They’re used to hard knocks, and they
go straight ahead when fellows like Putnam
flat out. That’s proved by the whole history of
the Academy.”</p>

<p>“What’s proved by the whole history of the
Academy?” asked Peck, with irritating calmness.</p>

<p>“Why, that fellows that earn their way make
the most successful men.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>“I haven’t said a word against fellows who
earn their own way,” retorted Peck, sharply.
“They may make the most successful men and
they may not. I don’t care anything about that.
But if you think that the history of the Academy
proves that every scholarship fellow becomes a
great and good man, you’re sadly off. The
scholarship fellows are of all kinds&mdash;good, bad,
and indifferent. Some are nice fellows; some are
dead beats, getting their board and clothes off
the Academy because it’s less work and more
fun than it would be to milk cows or work in the
shoe-shop; some seem to be training for crooks
or anarchists. They work their way because
they have to, that’s all. You don’t suppose
they prefer it, do you?”</p>

<p>“Mulcahy plays football, and is on the ‘Seatonian,’
and does well in his studies, and he is a
good speaker in the Laurel Leaf,” remarked
Archer, feeling suddenly his inexperience, and
returning to the personal example when general
assertion proved unsafe. “He amounts to more
than Kendrick, and yet you don’t make any
objection to Kendrick.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>“Kendrick is a good fellow,” said Duncan,
enigmatically.</p>

<p>“But Mulcahy isn’t!” completed Archer, with
a sarcastic grin.</p>

<p>“No, Mulcahy isn’t.” Duncan’s assertion was
made in the nonchalant fashion which we use in
stating generally accepted facts. A slight pause
ensued, which he broke with a sudden accession
of vehemence. “It’s no use to argue about such
fellows. Either you like ’em or you don’t. It’s
a matter of taste, and the way you have of looking
at fellows. We shan’t agree, because we
don’t think alike. You have your kind and I
have mine. You’ve a right to admire Mulcahy
and his gang if you want to. I suppose you’ve
got a right to bring him in here, too&mdash;as half the
room is yours.”</p>

<p>“I shall if I want to,” answered Sam, with
head high. “He’s just as good as&mdash;as we are.”</p>

<p>“That depends on the value you set on yourself,”
returned Duncan, coolly, taking his books
into his bedroom with the air of one who wished
to be alone.</p>

<p>Sam sat down at his desk, declaring scornful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
indifference to Duncan Peck and his snobbish
notions, but his thought ran rather on the discussion
just held than on the lesson before him.
Notwithstanding his assertion to the contrary,
he soon decided that he should not bring Mulcahy
round. It wasn’t the fair thing to impose an
unwelcome guest upon his room-mate. At the
same time he was clearly convinced that Peck’s
attitude was unworthy and contrary to the spirit
and ideals of the school. If he must choose
between Peck’s favor and the friendship of deserving
boys who were struggling to overcome
the handicap of poverty and make something of
themselves, he should not hesitate as to a choice.
The steady fellows toiling along the path trodden
by Webster and Lincoln were more honorable
companions than the sleek, empty-headed brats
of the newly rich!</p>

<p>This resolution to keep Mulcahy away from
7 Hale out of consideration for Peck, Sam broke
that very day&mdash;broke because he couldn’t
help himself. Mulcahy would come. To be
sure, he had a reason for coming,&mdash;to discuss
the election of the Laurel Leaf, of which literary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
society Archer had become a member; but he
stayed longer than was necessary for this purpose
and talked mainly about himself. Mulcahy was
a striking figure in the school. Of good size,
with well-poised head and bold, regular features
lighted up by brilliant dark eyes, ready of speech
and confident in manner, he gave the impression
of one who had a distinguished future before
him. He had not only the plausibility of a natural
politician, but a certain insinuating way of
taking another fellow into his confidence as if
he alone appreciated the other’s true value.
Sam had been captivated by Mulcahy’s winning
attentions early in his school career; he believed
in him and admired him.</p>

<p>Mulcahy was frankly ambitious. He was bound
to lift himself. When he had finished school&mdash;he
explained to Sam&mdash;he meant to study law
and get into politics in some large city; he might
go to college first if the way opened. He expected
to have to work hard to accomplish these ambitions,
especially as he believed in going in for
the outside things as far as possible&mdash;the “Seatonian”
and athletics and the literary societies.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
He tried to keep safely above the scholarship
line, and he did well with the influential profs.
He belonged to the Christian Fraternity, too;
it helped you with the profs to belong to that.</p>

<p>“When you have to fight your own way in the
world, you must take advantage of everything
that comes along,” he declared.</p>

<p>“It’s a great thing to do that, to educate
yourself,” said Sam, enthusiastically. “It develops
an ability that puts you ahead when you
come to real work in the world.”</p>

<p>Mulcahy looked at him sharply. “Yes, it
sounds well, but it isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.
If you tried it a month, you’d find out. Lots of
fellows in this school look down on us scholarship
fellows.”</p>

<p>“Not those whose opinion is worth anything,”
answered Sam, promptly. “Not the best fellows,
or the profs.”</p>

<p>“The profs don’t count,” said Mulcahy, “and
it’s hard to tell who are the best fellows. There’s
your room-mate, Peck, for instance. He speaks
to me on the street in a kind of condescending
way, and he wouldn’t be above taking a crib from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
me in recitation, but you don’t suppose he’d
invite me up here, do you?”</p>

<p>Sam blushed and twisted in his chair; he felt
thoroughly ashamed of his room-mate, sufficiently
ashamed to report with open indignation the
discussion which had recently been held on this
very subject. But an instinctive regard for
honorable dealing, an instinct which Sam felt
even when his faulty reason would have misled
him, closed his lips. “I’ve heard him speak
highly of Kendrick,” he said, at length finding a
clue. “He’s a scholarship man.”</p>

<p>“Kendrick!” ejaculated Mulcahy. “What’s
there to him? A common grind who’s had the
luck to be taken on the football squad!”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought he was a nice fellow,” remarked
Archer, puzzled at Mulcahy’s vehemence.
“What’s the matter with him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s good enough as fellows go,” replied
Mulcahy, “but it’s always seemed to me a green
kind of goodness. He doesn’t know any better.”</p>

<p>“Know any better!” echoed Sam, still puzzled.</p>

<p>“I mean he isn’t very keen,” Mulcahy explained.
“His wits are dull. You could take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
him in as easy as looking. He’s an honest fool,
and good-natured.”</p>

<p>Sam did not answer. He was wondering why
two fellows with the same hard problems of life
to solve shouldn’t sympathize with each other.
Mulcahy rose to go.</p>

<p>“I’ll count on you, then, in the election. Of
course, I don’t want the office, but we can’t
have those fellows running things to suit themselves
all the time. It’s contrary to the whole
spirit of the place. I wish you’d see Lord and
Kendrick and get them with us. They’d bring
others.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do all I can,” said Sam, cordially.

<span class="medium">MR. WORLDLY WISEMAN</span></h2>

<p>The blow fell; Hillbury routed the Seaton
eleven with ease. Sam had his mother and
twelve-year-old sister down for the occasion.
They came gay-trimmed and expectant, surveyed
the room with critical but forgiving eyes, took
luncheon at the Sedgwicks’, saw the game, and
departed by an evening train, witnessing with
unsympathetic curiosity the noisy antics of the
victors as they trooped to their special. Duncan
happened in at 7 Hale while the visitors were
there. He had the courtesy to hide any indifference
which he may have felt to the Archer family.
As a result, Mrs. Archer found him most agreeable,
and she gave cordial expression to her
opinion that Sam had been fortunate in his
room-mate. Peck listened politely and made an
acceptable response, but Sam, with a haste which
surprised his dear mother, switched the conversation
to another track.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p>After his guests had departed Sam returned
to his room and fell to brooding on the disappointments
of life. Being new to the school and
loyal, he was sensitive to the humiliation of the
defeat by Hillbury; he likewise felt his loneliness
in the big school in which he knew so many slightly
and cared especially for no one who cared for
him. His relations with Duncan kept him at a
distance from Duncan’s friends. In spite of his
championship of Mulcahy he did not find that
young man wholly satisfying as a companion.
The temptation to find relief in wrong ways
came up before him in a vaguely attractive form,
not strong enough to upset his moral balance,
but effectively adding to his sense of isolation.
John Fish in the room below had planned to
celebrate the victory. The victory failing, John
had resigned himself to celebrating defeat. He
did this by stealing out of town to a neighboring
city, whence he would steal back in the early
morning with gross boasts of his achievements
ready for trustworthy ears. John Fish was one
of those who never refuse themselves what they
crave if gratification is possible. He was too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
coarse and too vulgar to exert a winning influence
on Archer, but the thought of him to-night gave
a pessimistic trend to our young man’s philosophy.
He looked abroad through blue spectacles upon
a world of injustice in which the wicked triumphed.
There was Birdie Fowle, who never did anything
worse than make a noise or throw water out of a
window, and yet was deep in Mr. Alsop’s bad
books; the wise ones declared that Birdie wouldn’t
last long in school. John Fish, meanwhile, went
his quiet way unsuspected. Mr. Alsop always
had a good word for him as an orderly and serious-minded
youth; yet his sins compared to Fowle’s
were as boiler plate to blotting-paper.</p>

<p>Sam took up his French books to get ready for
Monday’s examination. Mr. Alsop was young
and strenuous, a good teacher, but saturated
with the conviction of his own importance, and
ambitious for distinction as a driver. He boasted
that he tolerated no sluggards in his courses;
he prided himself on his keenness in detecting
the goats before their whiskers had begun to
appear. The result was that many slow-minded
sheep got the credit of being goats, and many a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
wily old goat palmed himself off as an innocent
lamb. Mr. Alsop meant well, but went wrong;
and being wholly satisfied with the rectitude
of his intentions, he was the last to discover the
crookedness of his course. More than one unscrupulous
idler, by pretending that he was
struggling hard against natural inability, secured
better marks than he deserved. Others&mdash;among
them Sam&mdash;who said less and actually struggled
more were predestined from the beginning to D’s
and E’s. Sam felt that nothing short of a series
of phenomenal examination books could propitiate
fate. Convinced that the scales were weighted
against him, he worked half-heartedly. It was
with a sense of relief, after a quarter of an hour
of unprofitable study on his French, that he
hailed the interruption of Mulcahy.</p>

<p>“Plugging to-night?” asked the caller, in a
tone of surprise, as he dropped indolently into a
comfortable chair and hoisted his feet to the top
of a table.</p>

<p>“It’s got to be done,” replied Sam; “why not
to-night?”</p>

<p>“Because on the night of a Hillbury game
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
nobody expects to do anything. If we had won,
you’d have been out all the evening celebrating.”</p>

<p>“It was terrible, wasn’t it!” mourned Sam,
reminded anew of the school’s affliction.</p>

<p>“They got it right in the neck,” returned Mulcahy,
cheerfully. “Defence, attack, kicking, running,
forward passes, Hillbury put it all over ’em.
They won’t hold up their heads for a week. It’s
a very different thing being on an eleven that’s
had the stuffing beaten out of it, from playing a
winner.”</p>

<p>“You talk as if you were glad we got beaten,”
said Sam, gloomily.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I’m just making the best of the case.
There’s no use in crying about it. You and I
didn’t lose the game, anyway. Those that lost
will have to take the kicks now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they deserve kicks. They
played as well as they knew how. Kendrick was
a regular star. The way he stopped the rushes of
that big red-headed Hillbury half-back was wonderful!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did pretty well considering the short
time he’s been out,” Mulcahy conceded. “But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
what good was it? They got licked to their knees,
that’s the essential fact.”</p>

<p>“Who wrote that editorial in the ‘Seatonian’
special about the game?”</p>

<p>“I did,” replied Mulcahy, complacently.
“Wasn’t it smooth?”</p>

<p>“Well, your statements don’t hang together
then. In that you said that while the result of the
game was disappointing to Seaton, the main
thing, after all, was that it was well played and
fairly won; it was no disgrace to a team to be
beaten in such a contest.”</p>

<p>Mulcahy laughed heartily. “The ‘Seatonian’
was speaking then. The paper says what will
sound well and suit the profs. The editors think
what they please.”</p>

<p>“Do you write all the good advice the ‘Seatonian’
gives us, about studying, and maintaining
the reputation of the school, and acting up to
the Seaton spirit?”</p>

<p>“We all take a turn at it. It’s part of the
business.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe in it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sometimes; sometimes not. We don’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
have to.” Mulcahy was growing tired of the
subject. “What’re you working on, French?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve got an exam with Alsop Monday.”</p>

<p>“It’s an easy subject.”</p>

<p>“Not for me, and not with Alsop.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he isn’t bad if you don’t get him down on
you. You want to go to see him and ask his
opinion about things. Pretend to think a great
deal of him, and let him give you information&mdash;he
likes to do that&mdash;and confide in him some
trouble or other&mdash;not a real one, you know, but
something you’ve thought up. Get him going
on the comparative merits of ancient and modern
languages, if you can, and be convinced. He’s
’most as easy that way as Rounder. You’ll have
to do some plugging too, of course.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing to plug,” said Archer, dubiously,
“but I hate to talk with him.”</p>

<p>“Too bad you don’t have Rounder; he’s the
easiest thing there is,” went on Mulcahy. “Last
year Stevens and McCarthy were way down in his
class; they hadn’t either of ’em been doing a
thing above E. Both of ’em went to Doc Rounder
two weeks before the end of the term. Stevens
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
said: ‘Don’t you think I’ve been improving lately,
Doctor? I’ve been working terribly. It seems to
me I ought to have a D anyway.’ Doc Rounder
looks at his book and says: ‘Well, I don’t
know&mdash;have you been studying <i>very</i> hard?’
‘Two hours every lesson,’ says Stevens. ‘Perhaps
I can. We’ll see,’ says Doc. McCarthy
was nervier. He said: ‘Dr. Rounder, I think I
ought to have a B this time. I’ve made a great
improvement over last term.’ Rounder looked in
his book again and kind of hesitated; ‘I’m afraid
I can’t do it, McCarthy, your marks are too low.’
‘I ought to have B with the work I’ve put in it,&mdash;C
at least,’ McCarthy said, trying to look indignant.
Rounder said he’d think it over. Stevens
got D for a term mark, and McCarthy C&mdash;and
neither of ’em deserved a thing above E.”</p>

<p>“Had they been doing all that work?” asked
Sam, innocently.</p>

<p>“Naw, they hadn’t studied ten minutes a week.”</p>

<p>“Then they lied.”</p>

<p>Mulcahy laughed aloud. “Of course they lied.
Who wouldn’t to Rounder? Why, lying is the
one thing you learn in his course.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>Archer pondered this statement in silence.
Presently Mulcahy offered to help him with his
French, and they employed themselves for a half-hour
in looking up points on which Mr. Alsop was
considered likely to test his class in the examination.
After a time Mulcahy’s zeal slackened.
He tilted back in his chair, smoked a couple of
cigarettes, and talked of the coming election in the
Laurel Leaf.</p>

<p>“Scholarship men do smoke, then?” asked Sam,
as the conversation lagged. He knew well that
it was a strict rule that holders of scholarships
should not smoke.</p>

<p>“We’re not supposed to,” answered Mulcahy,
easily, “but you can’t always do what you’re
supposed to.”</p>

<p>“I should think they would smell it on your
clothes.”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty careful. Besides, you can always
lay it off on to some one you’ve been with. My
reputation would save me from suspicion anyway.
I could bluff my way out of it.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem quite square&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot! What’s a few cigarettes? It’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
just a question of getting ahead of the profs. The
faculty is on one side and we’re on the other.
They try to make us do what they want, and we
try to do what we please. They’ll soak us if they
can, and we beat ’em when we can. This isn’t
a Sunday-school; it’s a little piece cut out of the
world. If you’re going to get on here, you’ve got
to shake your kindergarten ideas, and play the
game.”</p>

<p>Mulcahy soon took himself away, and Sam went
early to bed to sleep off his low spirits. On the
next day he made an afternoon call at the Sedgwicks’
and yielded readily to an invitation to
supper. Miss Margaret was a mighty sorceress in
dispelling the grumps. In the evening he attended
the Christian Fraternity meeting, addressed by a
distinguished professor of Yale. Mulcahy sat in
a front row, and listened devoutly.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="medium">SLOW TO ANGER</span></h2>

<p>Regular exercise in the gymnasium began
immediately after the Hillbury game. In Sam’s
squad was a fellow from South Boston named
Dennis Runyon. Runyon possessed a head ornamented
with stiff, bristly hair on top, a stubby nose
and pimply cheeks in front, and flaring clam-shell
ears at the side. In the vacant spaces of his brain
lurked, with other delusions of a large and general
ignorance, a fixed idea that every man who
was not positively effeminate admired a pugilist.
Runyon’s notions as to the meaning of education
were hazy; he had come to Seaton with the somewhat
vague hope of bettering his prospects in life,
bearing a letter of introduction from a cousin who
had worked his way through the school and was
appreciative of the help which it had given him.
This letter from a faithful alumnus procured
Runyon’s admittance. Entering a lower class in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
which the work was, for him, largely review, he
gained rank high enough to receive a provisional
scholarship.</p>

<p>But Dennis Runyon’s ambitions were not
limited to gaining a foothold on the toilsome, uphill
road which the self-made man must travel;
he thirsted for distinction, especially distinction in
athletics. The school football team did not desire
his services; his class captain gave him a trial,
and quickly dropped him for a smaller man who
used his head more and his fists less. The football
season passed, the uneventful winter months
were at hand, his lesson marks were tending
steadily downward. The name of Runyon was
still obscure in Seaton.</p>

<p>Dennis went home for Thanksgiving, and offered
what excuses he could for his failure to make the
expected reputation.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know any fellows at all?” demanded
Pete Runyon, an older brother, who had brought
some glory upon the family by winning public
matches at various boxing clubs.</p>

<p>“Not many,” replied Dennis, candidly. “They
don’t take much notice of a new fellow.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>“Why don’t ye get up a fight, then? That’ll
show ’em what kind of a man ye are.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got any reason for fighting.”</p>

<p>“Find one, make one! Pick out one of these
fellows who’s stuck on himself and give him a
little jaw. He’ll fight when he gets mad enough.
Then give him a good upper cut and finish him off
easy. They’ll have some respect for you then.
Ain’t ye man enough for that?”</p>

<p>“I dunno.”</p>

<p>“Ye ought to be, then. What’ve I learned ye
to use yer paddies for? See what it’s done fer me!
When I go down the street, the’ ain’t a man in the
ward that don’t jump to give me the glad hand.
It’s so everywhere. Everybody likes a man that
can fight. The boys’ll talk about ye all over the
school. Ye’ll be somebody then!”</p>

<p>Dennis returned to school with his brother’s
counsel ringing in his ears. He experimented at
first with boasts, and anecdotes of hard bouts.
The bystanders listened with grins and suggested
that he try his skill on Legge. Legge was a heavy-weight
football player, old and hard, with the
torso of a Roman Hercules, and arms ridged with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
iron sinews. As Runyon was a light middle-weight,
this suggestion could only spring from gross
ignorance of the rules of the ring, or be prompted
by a spirit of ridicule. When flippant small boys
of his class, whose weakness was their protection,
fell to asking him, with mock solemnity, for details
of these encounters, he became gradually aware
that he was being chaffed. Something must be
done to impress the contemptuous with his worth.</p>

<p>Exactly why he chose Sam Archer as the person
on whom to try the value of his brother’s advice
is not easy to determine. Jealousy doubtless
entered into the case, a little personal spite, and
much of the cunning of the professional sport.
Sam’s democratic principles were not quite
broad enough to include a friendship with Runyon.
Sam had made a class football team when Runyon
had not. Sam was tall and therefore looked big,
yet being thin was presumably weak&mdash;a combination
much to be desired in the person to be used
by Runyon for demonstration of his prowess.
He was, moreover, an independent. Not being a
member of any close organization, he was not
always surrounded by friends who felt themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
privileged to interfere in his affairs; and though
not a fraternity man or a great athlete, he was
not so obscure that a victory over him would be
inglorious.</p>

<p>Having selected his victim, Runyon’s only problem
was to make him fight. It happened soon that
chance threw a pretext directly in his way, though
he was not quick enough to recognize it. Archer,
in the hurried crowding to put away dumbbells
after the exercise, stepped on Runyon’s heel and
pulled his gymnasium slipper loose. Runyon
turned with a scowl, but before his mind awoke to
the opportunity Archer had begged his pardon and
passed on. The next day Runyon deliberately
trod on Archer’s heel, and did not apologize.
The result, however, was disappointing; Sam
adjusted his shoe and went his way without
bestowing a look on the offender.</p>

<p>The boxer now had recourse to more aggressive
measures. He pushed young Hartley into Archer
on the gymnasium floor, but it was Hartley who
turned on him with abuse&mdash;and Hartley was too
small to notice. He commented with audible contempt
on Sam’s performance on the vaulting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
horse. As he passed Taylor and Archer talking
together at the head of the gymnasium stairs,
he mocked the phrase which had just fallen from
Sam’s lips, and lingered near by to see if his
challenge would be taken up.</p>

<p>“What’s that fellow driving at?” demanded
Taylor. “Is he trying to get up a scrap with
you?”</p>

<p>“It looks like it,” replied Sam. “Perhaps it’s
just his way of being funny.”</p>

<p>“He’s getting too fresh. He ought to be
squelched!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be the one to do it. You
don’t gain anything by scrapping with fellows
like him.”</p>

<p>Sam’s evident unwillingness to be drawn was
just the incentive needed to urge his assailant on.
Runyon was one who could be bluffed or cowed,
but not placated. Sam was by nature good-humored
and patient, capable of holding out on a
fixed course to the last gasp, but neither resentful
nor pugnacious. When Collins informed Bruce
that Archer was good material, but must get speed
and fight into him before he could accomplish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
anything, the coach showed himself a shrewd judge
of character, as well as an expert in the psychology
of successful racers. As Archer sought to avoid
him, Runyon’s conduct grew more offensive.
Both were criticised severely by spectators of
the performance, the one for not standing up
for his rights, the other for acting like a hoodlum.</p>

<p>The crisis came one day early in December,
when Runyon, having flung out an unsuccessful
gibe in the dressing room, overtook Archer on
the stairs and jostled roughly against him.
Sam, at last exasperated, gave the bully a push
with his shoulder that sent the intrepid challenger
hard against the side wall. Runyon rebounded,
and striking Archer a blow in the upper arm,
squared himself for battle.</p>

<p>“Come on, if you want to fight!” he called
derisively. “I didn’t believe you had sand
enough.”</p>

<p>“I won’t fight here,” answered Archer.</p>

<p>“Ye won’t fight anywhere, I guess. You’re
too much of a coward!”</p>

<p>By this time boys were gathering above and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
below, and staring at the brawlers with eager,
grinning faces.</p>

<p>“Don’t stand his lip, Sam,” said Kendrick,
pushing his way up the steps. “Knock the face
off him!”</p>

<p>Runyon turned sharply toward the intruder.
Whatever his intention, he suppressed it as soon
as he recognized the stalwart football player.
“He’ll knock the face off me, nit!” said the pugilist.
“He won’t even give me a chance to get at
him. Shorty Hartley’s about his class.”</p>

<p>The gong for the beginning of exercise sounded.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a chance this afternoon,” said
Sam, hastily.</p>

<p>“Yes, you will!” sneered Runyon, “probably
when you have a crowd of friends to butt in.”</p>

<p>“When we can have it out alone,” declared Sam,
with a hard look in his eyes and an air of extreme
dignity. “I’ll send a second to you this noon.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="medium">THE FURY OF A PATIENT MAN</span></h2>

<p>The more Archer considered the matter, the
more disgusted he became. It was totally unreasonable
and absurd. Runyon had apparently
set his heart on forcing a fight&mdash;why, Runyon
alone knew. Sam felt himself the victim of an
inexplicable persecution. He couldn’t hand the
persecutor over to friends to chastise, he couldn’t
complain to the faculty, he couldn’t put up forever
with insults and humiliations. He simply must
fight&mdash;unless Mulcahy’s sharp wits could devise
a way of silencing the rowdy.</p>

<p>Sam found Mulcahy before luncheon, and
appealed for help.</p>

<p>“What did you get into such a scrape for?”
demanded Mulcahy, with small show of sympathy.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my fault; he forced me into it.”</p>

<p>“You must have done something to him. He
wouldn’t pick on you without some kind of reason.”</p>

<p>“Not a thing. I don’t think I’d ever spoken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
to him. He’s making a fool of himself and me too.
Can’t you go to him and show him how idiotic it
is, and get him to shut up? If you don’t succeed
in that, tell him I’m ready to fight.”</p>

<p>Mulcahy drew away. “I couldn’t do that,
really. It wouldn’t do for me to interfere. I’d
like to help you, of course, but I couldn’t get
mixed up in a thing of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Archer, perplexed at his
friend’s coldness.</p>

<p>“Well, it would be talked about; some of the
faculty would hear of it, and they might not understand
my position in it. I couldn’t have them
think I was acting as second in a school prize-fight.
Then my position on the ‘Seatonian’ has to be
considered.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what that has to do with it,” said
Archer, gloomily. “I’ve got into trouble with a
cheap mutt, from no fault of mine. I’ve got to
have some one to help me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you by giving you the best advice I
know. Go to Runyon quietly and fix it up.”</p>

<p>“Fix it up!” echoed Archer. “How can I
fix it up?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>“Why, tell him you acted thoughtlessly, and
are sorry you pushed him. Beg his pardon, and
when the thing is over and settled, avoid him.
If you don’t patch it up, you’ll be walloped by a
good fighter, and very likely get kicked out of
school into the bargain.”</p>

<p>Sam stared&mdash;glared&mdash;at his counsellor. “Go
down on my knees to that fellow!” he said, with
vibrant voice and flashing eyes. “Swallow all the
insults he’s given me and ask for more, beg his
pardon for not taking his dirty kicks with gratitude!
I wouldn’t do that for a dozen ‘Seatonians’
and a hundred faculties. I wouldn’t do
that for any one, not if I knew I was going to be
fired the next minute!”</p>

<p>“Don’t blame me, then, if things don’t go
right,” returned Mulcahy, seating himself at his
desk as if the interview were over. “You’ll just
get into the scrape deeper. I’ve given you the
best advice I know. My conscience is clear.”</p>

<p>Sam flung out of Mulcahy’s room without a
backward glance or a word. Furious with Mulcahy
and with the whole ridiculous business, he
strode along vowing he would fight without a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
second, anywhere, at any time. At the corner of
Sibley he ran into Kendrick.</p>

<p>“Look out there!” sang out Kendrick’s cheerful
voice. “What’re you rushing me for? I’m
not Runyon.”</p>

<p>Sam’s face brightened. “Say, Ken, will you
be my second if I have to fight that fellow?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I will,” responded the ready Kendrick.
“But why do you say ‘if’? You’ve <i>got</i> to fight
him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you might go to him and show
him what a fool he’s making&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do a bit of good,” interrupted
Kendrick. “Nothing’ll cure his disease but some
good hard punches in the head. I’d just as lief
go and tell him what a fool he is as not. Maybe
I’d get a chance to hand him a few myself. Only
it wouldn’t do any good.”</p>

<p>“You won’t get into any trouble with the profs
by backing me, will you?” questioned Sam, mindful
of Mulcahy’s fears.</p>

<p>“Trouble? Supposing I do? The job’s got
to be done, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Then go and tell him to come to my room
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
after the four o’clock bell rings. Alsop is at recitation
then. He can bring some one with him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Kendrick, cordially. “Trust
the thing to me. I’ll arrange everything in proper
style, giving him a little of my opinion at the same
time. Four o’clock this afternoon at 7 Hale!”</p>

<p>Mr. Alsop took his books and his dignity over
to recitation that afternoon, little suspecting the
plot against the boasted quiet of his entry. Kendrick
had cleared the centre of the room of movables,
and now sat on the sofa, nursing his knee
and giving final words of counsel. Sam had put
on tennis shoes, an old pair of trousers and a
jersey, and over this had thrown his coat.</p>

<p>“Don’t accept any rules at all,” advised Kendrick.
“Just wade in and hit him any old way.
You aren’t fighting for a diamond belt, you’re
just defending yourself against bullying; close
in on him or throw him; then pummel him. If
you stand off, he’ll whack you. You want to rush
him.”</p>

<p>“It’s the craziest fool thing I ever got into,”
groaned Sam. “There’s no sense in it at all. I
never did anything to the mucker.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p>“What’s the good of going over that again!
When a rowdy sets on you in the street, you’ve
got either to fight or to run. It’s no use to tell
him he isn’t acting like a gentleman. If Runyon
insists on fighting, you’ve got to fight him, or get
some one else to do it for you, or appeal to the
faculty for protection.”</p>

<p>“I know it!” growled Sam, whose temper was
growing vicious. “I’m going to fight.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to win, too,” observed Kendrick,
with a sage nod, falling in naturally with the
orthodox practice of encouragement pursued
by seconds since the days of Homer. “He’s
nothing.”</p>

<p>A bold knock at the door announced the coming
of the enemy. Runyon walked in, followed by
Brantwein, his supporter. Brantwein was a
radical, avowing and defending extreme socialist
ideas. He was beating his way through the
school. He sold peanuts to the fellows on the
bleachers at the ball games, devised various means,
effective and ineffective, of getting marks without
excessive work, put the shot with considerable
success, and protested generally that his name did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
not mean “brandy,” because it was not spelled
with a double <i>n</i>. None the less he was dubbed
“Brandy” from the day of his advent. He was
generally against the government, and he liked
a scrap.</p>

<p>Runyon took off his coat immediately. “We’ll
follow the Marquis of Queensberry rules,” he proclaimed.
“No hitting below the belt and no
clinching.”</p>

<p>“Rules nothing!” answered Kendrick, curtly.</p>

<p>“What’s all this for, anyway?” said Archer.
“I’ve nothing against you to fight over.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got something against you,” returned
Runyon, “and you ain’t goin’ to crawl out of it
now!”</p>

<p>At this taunt a white spot appeared on each of
Sam’s cheekbones, and an ominous light flashed
into his eyes. He drew off his coat&mdash;slowly,
because he wanted time to consider his opening.
Runyon caught the change of color in his opponent’s
face, and misinterpreted its meaning. Fearing
that the long-suffering Archer might be still
reluctant to use his fists, and that the &eacute;clat which
he had striven for might at the last moment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
escape him, he stepped forward and swung the
flat of his hand in a stinging slap against Sam’s
cheek.</p>

<p>The effect far exceeded Runyon’s expectations.
Sam’s long-suppressed anger at being forced into
a ridiculous position flared into scorching fury.
With every nerve alert and every muscle quivering,
he flung the coat aside and leaped forward.
He came too quick and too hard for his enemy’s
artistic defence. The blow that should have
felled him to the floor, wildly and feebly aimed,
glanced harmless from his lowered, plunging head.
The next instant, Sam’s arms were encircling
Runyon’s waist, his head was planted safely against
his opponent’s chest; the on-rush of his dive
swept the boxer, drumming vainly on the muscle-armored
shoulders, back against the wall. They
struck the doorpost with a force that slammed
Runyon’s head against the wood. Before he
could recover, Archer caught his footing, and
whirling his confused assailant about, threw him
to the floor and fell heavily upon him.</p>

<p>What followed was totally contrary to the conduct
expected of a well-mannered hero of a boy’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
book. Never was mighty fighter so soon despoiled
of his martial ardor, or so quickly brought to
piteous appeal for mercy. The seconds together
dragged the infuriated tiger from his prey. And
while Kendrick in the corner of the study was
bringing Archer back to his normal state of charity
and patience, Brantwein was swabbing Runyon’s
swelling, red-smeared face in the bedroom, and
muttering a combination of consolations and
invectives.</p>

<p>“He didn’t fight fair!” sputtered Runyon,
when his breath returned and his throat was clear.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” retorted the socialist. “You
got what was coming to you.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you the way to fix him!” boasted
Kendrick, when the door closed behind the
battered, cowed Runyon and his disappointed
second. “If you had fought according to ring
rules, he’d have knocked you all over the
place.”</p>

<p>“Supposing he had done it, what then?” asked
Sam, looking ruefully at his knuckles.</p>

<p>“Then I should have insulted him,” answered
Kendrick, promptly, “and if he did for me, some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
one else would have come up. He’d never have
got through the year without a good whaling.”</p>

<p>Runyon went home the next day for comfort
and repairs. And when he was repaired and comforted,
not daring or not caring to face the jeers
of his schoolmates, he decided not to return to the
scene of his defeat, but to work in a department
store instead. Some time after his disappearance,
some innocent asked a friendly instructor whether
Runyon was expelled on account of his fight with
Archer, and thus put the keen noses of the faculty
on the scent. So, long after the school had ceased
to talk of it, the history of the Battle of 7 Hale
was revealed to the authorities.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="medium">DUNCAN’S DISGUST</span></h2>

<p>Despite his fears, Sam never heard from the
faculty with reference to his duel. He had, on
the whole, proved to his teachers his right to be
considered a law-abiding citizen, if not a distinguished
scholar; and the accepted student
version of the affair showed him anything but an
aggressor. Mr. Alsop, while consenting to the
verdict of acquittal, adhered in silence to his
own opinion, which held Sam accountable for
the desecration of the well by a low fight.</p>

<p>This, however, was a month after the event.
Mulcahy had come over on the very evening to
offer congratulations.</p>

<p>“You were lucky to get out of it so easily,”
he said. “The fact is that I thought Runyon
would be too much for you, so the best thing was
to switch him off. I didn’t like the idea of your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
being mauled about by a rough bully like him.
That’s why I tried to keep you back.”</p>

<p>“But I simply couldn’t put up any longer with
the treatment he was giving me,” protested Sam.
“That was worse than fighting and getting
licked. I hadn’t any self-respect left.”</p>

<p>“I hoped you would be able to patch it up.
I see now that I was wrong, but I was terribly
afraid he’d do you some injury.”</p>

<p>Sam uttered a low laugh&mdash;quite the good-natured
victor. “Well, he didn’t. My knuckles
are the only sore spot on me.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing you got Kendrick into it
with you. He’ll be more likely to come over to
our side on the Laurel Leaf matter. Have you
talked with him yet?”</p>

<p>Sam shook his head.</p>

<p>“Be as careful with him as you can. Make
him see that we want to get the offices out of
the hands of the oligarchy, back into the school.
It’s a shame that a democratic institution like
the Academy should be bossed by the few fellows
in the fraternities.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it chiefly because the frats have got some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
of the best fellows in them?” asked Sam, innocently.</p>

<p>“No! They have some good fellows and a lot
who wouldn’t be anything if they didn’t have
money behind them. They put a frat man forward,
and the rank and file just sit still and vote
him in.”</p>

<p>“The rank and file don’t care much about it
anyway.”</p>

<p>“They ought to, and they will when they’re
aroused. It’s up to us to show them how to
protect their rights.”</p>

<p>After Mulcahy went, Sam compared the statement
which his guest had just made about the
duel, with the reasons which he had given the
day before when he refused to act as second.
“He was really afraid to have anything to do
with it,” he mused. “I don’t believe those
fellows he’s so down on would have gone back
on a friend in that way. Still, I ought not to
blame him for that; he has his way to make;
he can’t afford to get into trouble with the profs.”
The contrasting conduct of Kendrick, who also
had his way to make, occurred to him, and shook
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
his faith in his own argument. “But Ken is a
natural scrapper,” he reassured himself. “Ken
would do ’most anything to see a fight.”</p>

<p>One thing, however, Ken would not do&mdash;vote
for Mulcahy for office. That Archer discovered
as soon as he broached the subject.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t vote for him for street sweeper!”
he declared. “Mulcahy’s a pig, and a grafter.
He’s all for Mulcahy, and for nobody and nothing
else. If he wants a thing, on general principles
I don’t want it. If he says a course is right, I’m
sure it isn’t. He works everything and everybody
he can get hold of. He’s got the faculty hypnotized
into believing he’s an angel. I wouldn’t
trust him around the corner.”</p>

<p>“He’s a mighty able fellow,” replied Archer,
who charged Kendrick’s vehemence up against
prejudice and envy; “a lot abler than Metcalf,
or Dupont, or&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Or me&mdash;” put in Kendrick, fervid, but ungrammatical.
“He’s all that&mdash;everything but
straight.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen anything crooked about him,”
Sam persisted. “He’s been a very good friend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
to me. I should think as you’re both in the same
boat, you’d sympathize with him.”</p>

<p>“How are we both in the same boat?”</p>

<p>“Why, you both have to rely on yourselves
for what you get. You are both scholarship men.”</p>

<p>Kendrick looked relieved. “Is that all you
meant! I was afraid you thought we were in
some way alike. If that was so, I was going to
change right off so as to be different. Mulcahy’s
a crook!”</p>

<p>“He’s a friend of mine, if you please,” said
Sam, with dignity.</p>

<p>“What has he ever done for you, anything?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s helped me with lessons and given
me advice.”</p>

<p>“Advice is cheap. You can get it by the hour
down in Alsop’s room. If he’s given you free
tutoring, that’s something.”</p>

<p>“It hasn’t been very much,” confessed Sam.
“I didn’t need it.”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t much use to you in your row with
Runyon, was he? If you’d followed his advice
then, you’d have been to the bad altogether.”</p>

<p>“He meant well; he was afraid I’d get hurt,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
announced Sam; and then, to cut short this
discussion of Mulcahy’s virtues, he asked, “Then
you won’t vote for him?”</p>

<p>“Vote for him? Never. I’d rather vote for
myself! I’m more or less of a fool, but I have a
little principle, and there are some things I’m
too good or too proud to do. There’s nothing
Mulcahy wouldn’t do, if he could make anything
by it, and was sure nobody saw him. Don’t be
surprised if you find me electioneering against
him.”</p>

<p>Sam went back to his room disgusted. The
causes of his disgust were so complex, that he
couldn’t possibly disentangle them. He imagined
the chief one to be his failure to accomplish his
object with Kendrick, and the latter’s colossal
prejudice against Mulcahy. In fact, he was
beginning to feel the difficulty of defending his
friend from insinuations against him, and to be
annoyed that it was necessary to do so. He found
Peck standing before the grate with hands clasped
behind him, and a black frown on his face.</p>

<p>“I hear you’ve been turning this place into a
prize ring,” began Duncan. “Hereafter when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
you have these little affairs with your friends I
wish you’d hold ’em somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t have any more. I didn’t want this
one. I tried as hard as I could to keep out of it.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t have to hold it here, did you?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. I didn’t know where else to go.
I thought you wouldn’t be here.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had been. I’d have stopped it
mighty quick. Runyon and Brandy Brantwein
and Mulcahy and you! That combination would
ruin any room’s reputation!”</p>

<p>“Mulcahy wasn’t here!” said Sam, sullenly.</p>

<p>“Who was it, then?”</p>

<p>“Kendrick.”</p>

<p>Duncan stared. “I wonder how he got into
it,” he said at length.</p>

<p>“He knew I was forced into the thing and he
wanted to help me out,” answered Sam, quickly.
“That’s more than some fellows I know would
do,” he added with scornful emphasis.</p>

<p>Duncan’s stern look melted into a malicious
grin. “More than Mulcahy would do, I’ll bet.
He isn’t running any more risks than he can help.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any risk!” said Sam, bravely.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>“There wasn’t? Why, you’ll every one of you
be fired when the faculty gets on to it.”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” Sam remarked with a confidence
which was not altogether sincere.</p>

<p>“That Mulcahy has the crust of a crocodile,”
went on Peck. “I understand he’s trying to
elect himself president of the Leaf.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Peck,” said Sam, holding his head
high, “I wish you’d leave Mulcahy out of the
conversation hereafter. He’s a friend of mine,
and I don’t care to hear him abused all the time.
If you don’t want to vote for him, you’re not
obliged to. There’ll be other candidates. He
has brains and ability, but perhaps they don’t
count as much in your eyes as clothes and a big
allowance and membership in a frat.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t so,” snapped Duncan. “I don’t
care anything about money, but I hate a mucker
whether he’s rich or poor.”</p>

<p>“Mulcahy isn’t a mucker. My opinion on
that point is worth more than yours, for I know
him better than you do. He’s going home with
me over next Sunday. That shows what I think
of him.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>Archer spoke with six feet of dignity and the
gravity of a judge handing down a decision, but
Peck was totally unimpressed. “I hope he
won’t steal the silver,” he said with an exasperating
twinkle,&mdash;“the old silver!”</p>

<p>Sam blushed, and cursed himself that he had
ever been fool enough to tell Peck anything.
And while he blushed and sought vainly for a
crushing reply, Peck went whistling off to his
bedroom, disposed to think rather better of his
room-mate after all. If you believe in your
friends, it’s your business to stand up for them&mdash;until
you find them out.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="medium">A REVELATION OF CHARACTER</span></h2>

<p>There was no danger of lack of quorum at
the election of the Laurel Leaf. Every faithful
wheelhorse, every indifferent who had joined
“to please the folks at home,” every intermittently
interested member hastened to the society rooms
with ballot in his hand and zeal in his heart.
The tide set hard against the champion of democracy.
Underwood was elected by a vote representing
two-thirds of the society.</p>

<p>Greatly chagrined and deeply sympathizing
with his defeated friend, Sam took Mulcahy home
to 7 Hale to console him. Peck, who happened
to be in, greeted them coldly, and withdrew in
such marked haste that Sam, fearful lest Mulcahy
should resent the intended slight, hastily pushed
his best chair forward and invited his guest
cordially to sit down. Mulcahy, however, showed
himself in no wise sensitive. He settled into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
comfortable chair and composedly lit a cigarette,
less like a young reformer who had suffered a
great disappointment, than a shrewd old philosopher
to whom a single defeat was but one of
the little annoyances of life, to be smiled over and
forgotten.</p>

<p>“When are you going to begin to smoke?”
he asked, as Sam drew his chair to the fireplace
beside him.</p>

<p>“Not for a long time,” answered Sam, “perhaps
never.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“My family don’t want me to, for one thing.
Then I want to keep myself in good condition.”</p>

<p>“Most fellows wouldn’t care much for either
of those reasons,” said Mulcahy. “You’re expected
to do what the rest do.”</p>

<p>Sam did not reply to this; he was thinking
how hard it often was to resist doing the things
which the rest did.</p>

<p>“People at home don’t know anything about
what is necessary in a school like this,” continued
Mulcahy. “If you want to get on, you mustn’t
go against the crowd.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>“I don’t care anything about getting on,”
said Sam. “I’m not ambitious.”</p>

<p>“You’d like to be popular, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“No!” Sam answered decidedly. “I shouldn’t
want to be disliked, but holding office and that
kind of thing doesn’t interest me. There’s too
much hard feeling and disappointment.”</p>

<p>Mulcahy laughed. “You don’t know anything
about it. Now, I got beaten to-night. Do you
suppose I’m discouraged? Not a bit. I’ll lie
low for a while and work my game and wait. By
and by things will come my way. If you just
hang on to a thing long enough, don’t make mistakes
and don’t get mad, you wear away the
opposition after a time. There’s another election
this year, and there’s another year after this.
I’ll be president of the Laurel Leaf before I leave
this place. See if I don’t.”</p>

<p>Again a silence. Sam believed in Mulcahy’s
prophecy, but the tone of it grated on him.</p>

<p>It was not Mulcahy’s habit to take people into
his confidence. But to-night, as he lolled in
Archer’s comfortable easy-chair, flattered by the
attentions and admiration of this boy of superior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
strain, he relaxed his caution and gave a glimpse
of his real self.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I do summers?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Work, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“At what?”</p>

<p>Sam shook his head. “You’ve never told me.”</p>

<p>“I sell books. I can go into a factory&mdash;when
they’ll let me in&mdash;and sell books right through
from floor to floor, to men and women both.
I’ve sold books bound in morocco for six dollars
to women who didn’t earn that a week. I used
to be so successful that when I came to deliver
the books, they’d pretend I’d used unfair means
to get their signatures. Yet it was all done by
holding on and not taking offence, and flattering
and agreeing with people.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think much of getting poor women to
pay a week’s wages for a book when they need
every cent they can earn for food and clothes,”
said Sam, bluntly.</p>

<p>“Oh, perhaps they earned more than six dollars.
It don’t matter. They’re bound to throw away
about so much anyway.”</p>

<p>“How old are you?” asked Sam.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>“I’ll be twenty-one next July.”</p>

<p>“You’re only three years older than I am, but
I couldn’t do that kind of thing if I were fifty.”
Sam did not say exactly what he meant, which
was that he couldn’t do that kind of thing under
any circumstances.</p>

<p>“I just mentioned it to show what hanging on
will do. I don’t really care anything about this
Laurel Leaf office except as a help to something
else.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>Mulcahy looked at his host doubtfully under
the rising twists of smoke. “You won’t speak
of it to any one?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, if you don’t want me to.”</p>

<p>“You know what the Yale Cup is?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Never heard of it.”</p>

<p>“The Yale Club of Boston gives a cup every
year in three or four big schools to the senior
who ‘combines the greatest excellence in athletics
with good standing in his studies.’ That’s the
way it reads in the catalogue. It’s awarded at
Commencement, with a whole batch of other
prizes. In June of our senior year I want that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
cup. The greatest difficulty is about the athletics.
I’m going to try hard for the football team
next fall, and I’ll do something with the pole
vault this year. With the ‘Seatonian’ and the
presidency of the Laurel Leaf, and good rank in
studies, and the favor of several influential profs,
which I’m working for, I ought to have a good
show.”</p>

<p>“Do you apply for it?” asked simple Sam.</p>

<p>“No, foolish! The faculty picks out the man.”</p>

<p>Mulcahy threw the stub of his fourth cigarette
into the fireplace and lighted another. “That’s
a prize worth having,” he went on, “for it means
that the winner is a superior, all-round man. I’m
going in for the Merrill compositions too, and perhaps
for the speaking. They’re cash prizes, you
know; but as honors they aren’t in it with the
Yale Cup.”</p>

<p>“Did Owen get it last year?”</p>

<p>“No, he wasn’t a good enough scholar. He did
well enough in athletics, but he was only about a
C man in his studies.”</p>

<p>“That would be a perfectly bully thing to take
home with you, wouldn’t it?” broke forth Sam,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
in honest enthusiasm. “Your father and mother
would be tickled to death with the scholarship
part of it, and the honor of the athletics would
make you feel like a prince. I’d rather get a thing
like that than have an auto of my own.”</p>

<p>Mulcahy smiled complacently. “I really don’t
care much about athletics. I only go in for them
because it’s at present the thing to do.”</p>

<p>A light step was heard in the entry, followed
immediately by a knock at the door. Mulcahy
put his cigarette on the edge of the table, and
shoved his chair away; Sam turned his half
round. “Come in!” he cried.</p>

<p>The door opened to admit Mr. Alsop. “Good
evening,” he began, as both students rose, and
Mulcahy retreated still farther from the table.
“I came to inquire the result of your election.”</p>

<p>“I was badly beaten,” said Mulcahy, with
charming frankness. “They wouldn’t have me.
Underwood was the honored man.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see that you take it so well,” said
Mr. Alsop. “That’s the spirit I like in school
politics.” He stopped short, suddenly aware of
the thick atmosphere of smoke and the pungent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
penetrating odor of cigarettes. “Why, Archer!”
he exclaimed, turning sternly on Sam, “you told
me the other day that you did not smoke at all!”</p>

<p>Sam flushed to the roots of his hair; his look
glanced from the reproving countenance of the
teacher to the calm face of Mulcahy. He did
not answer.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t smoke much, I can assure you,”
Mulcahy broke in quickly. “I think he was
tempted to try a cigarette to-night to comfort
himself over our defeat.”</p>

<p>Mr. Alsop sniffed the air. “There’s more than
one cigarette in the atmosphere of this room.”</p>

<p>Sam raised his eyes sullenly to the teacher’s,
shot a swift, significant glance at Mulcahy, and
looked out across the table at the red banner upon
the wall. He said nothing, for there was nothing
that he could say.</p>

<p>“There’s a great difference between not smoking
at all and smoking a little,” the teacher continued
in a severe lecture tone. “As I have
explained, we do not forbid smoking, except to
scholarship men; we try to discourage it all we
can, because we consider it harmful. You told
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
me that you did not smoke. I find you smoking.
You have not been honest with me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Alsop paused to give Archer an opportunity
to reply. Sam racked his brain for some non-committal
form of words, and found none. “Yes,
sir,” he said desperately.</p>

<p>“He probably thought, sir, that he smoked so
little that it was practically none at all,” interposed
Mulcahy. “I’ve never seen him smoking
before to-night.”</p>

<p>“He should have said so, then,” declared Mr.
Alsop, addressing Mulcahy. “My question was a
friendly one and should have been frankly answered.”
He faced the culprit again, who, with
angry red cheeks and hostile, defiant eyes, now
looked squarely at him. “I want to be helpful
to you, Archer, but I can’t be that unless you trust
me. If you had been honest with me, I shouldn’t
have said anything different to you then from
what I am saying now, but it would have been
pleasanter for you to hear. Any smoking at all
is bad for a boy of your age. The habit will grow
on you, if once you get it, in spite of you. It will
interfere with your physical and mental growth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
and unfit you to do your best in studies or in
athletics.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Sam, whose indignation over
the unfair treatment which he was enduring did
not prevent his recognizing the truth of the instructor’s
words.</p>

<p>“Good night!”</p>

<p>With this abrupt salutation, Mr. Alsop went his
way downstairs, wholly satisfied with his own conduct,
but confessing serious disappointment with
certain of the boys under his care. If only Archer
were as straightforward, and Fowle as orderly, as
John Fish, the well would be less a source of uneasiness
to him and less damaging to his pride. Archer
evidently needed watching; and Fowle&mdash;well,
Fowle would certainly have to go before the end of
another term. That boy’s perpetual disregard of
rules and apparent contempt for authority were
unendurable!

<span class="medium">MR. ALSOP’s DIGNITY</span></h2>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry!” began Mulcahy, vehemently,
as soon as the door had closed behind the
departing form of Mr. Alsop. “I’m awfully sorry,
but I couldn’t help it. There wasn’t any other
way out.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” answered Archer, with sullen
sarcasm.</p>

<p>Mulcahy came round the table and put his
hand on Archer’s shoulder. Sam threw it off
and edged away.</p>

<p>“Just try to think of it from my side,” urged
Mulcahy. “Here I was, caught in the act. If
Alsop had wanted to make a row about it, I might
have lost my scholarship. They’d all have been
down on me, anyway, and it would have been
terribly hard to get them over to my side again;
while as for you&mdash;” He hesitated at this point,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
not sure how to put his idea into unobjectionable
form.</p>

<p>“While as for me,” flamed Archer, “all I get is
to have Alsop tell all the rest that I’m a liar and
going to the bad as fast as I can. That’s nothing
at all!”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy!” answered Mulcahy, smiling
compassionately at his companion’s vehemence.
“Nothing like that will happen. You’ve a right
to smoke if you want to. Alsop understands that.
I smoothed out all the difficulty about your telling
him that you didn’t. You won’t hear from it
again. Alsop won’t think any differently of you
from what he always has.”</p>

<p>“No different, but more so,” interjected Sam,
bitterly.</p>

<p>“While as for me, why, my whole life plans
might be spoiled.”</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> life plans don’t make any difference, do
they?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t any. You don’t need to have any.
A fellow in your position, with all the bills paid
for you, and everything provided for years to come,
doesn’t know what it is to have to struggle along
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
with your head just above water, always afraid
a big wave will roll up and swamp you.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you think of that when you lighted
the cigarettes?” demanded Sam, roughly. “What
business have you to smoke at all? You know the
rules.”</p>

<p>“The rules are silly for a man of my age,” returned
Mulcahy. “If I’d known Alsop was going
to butt in, of course I wouldn’t have done it.”</p>

<p>“It’s done now, anyway,” sighed Archer, looking
at his watch. “I don’t know about you,
but I’ve got to do some studying to-night. I can’t
let Alsop flunk me to-morrow, after this.”</p>

<p>“I’m going,” said the visitor. He held out
his hand with his best, most flattering smile.
“Good-by, Sammy. You showed yourself the
right sort of a friend to-night. I shan’t forget
it.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” thought Sam, as he gave back a feeble
pressure and muttered a return good-night.</p>

<p>When Mulcahy was gone, Sam sat down by the
lamp with his books spread out before him. For
a long time, however, he let his eyes stray past them
to the shaded corner of the room, while with tight-pressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
lips and wrinkled brow he considered his
experiences since he came to Seaton, and pronounced
himself a fool. He had not been a fool
in every respect, it was true; he hadn’t been fresh,
or boastful about himself, and he had not done
things flagrantly wrong, but he saw clearly that
many of his judgments had been mistaken.
Strangely enough, the irritating incident of the
evening did not so greatly depress him. He felt
a certain satisfaction in the superiority of his behavior
as compared with Mulcahy’s, which served
to offset the uneasiness caused by the teacher’s
error. But he did wish that he hadn’t committed
himself so far to intimacy with Mulcahy, and he
regretted that he had invited him home for Sunday.</p>

<p>In the distractions of the evening, Sam overlooked
one part of the French lesson for the next
day. Mr. Alsop had given notice of a test on
vocabulary, a comparatively easy matter to prepare
if he had only remembered to study it. He
was unpleasantly reminded of this omission at
the recitation next morning, when Mr. Alsop
announced that all those who failed to write correctly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
the English equivalents of twenty of the
twenty-five French words on the paper, must come
to a “make-up” on Saturday at five. Sam had
forgotten to study his vocabulary. He struggled
over the list, and succeeded in getting but eighteen
of the twenty-five. On Saturday morning Mr.
Alsop read his name among those doomed to the
five-o’clock make-up.</p>

<p>To be present at five o’clock on Saturday meant
a late train home and the evening spoiled. Sam
had secured out-of-town permission from the office,
and had arranged to escort his mother to a meeting
of his old school athletic association in the evening.
It seemed hard&mdash;unjust&mdash;to be cut off from this
prearranged visit, in order to take an exercise
which involved hardly five minutes and could be
as well taken at some other time. So the boy,
having fretted and reviled for an hour, called at
Mr. Alsop’s room, and after explaining that the
make-up would prevent his going home, offered
to take it in the instructor’s room immediately
after his return.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you should have a privilege
which the others have not; and I don’t see why I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
should sacrifice my time to save a student from
the results of his own neglect,” said Mr. Alsop,
tartly. Like many a serious but narrow-minded
pedagogue, he was taking the wholesale failure of
the class as a personal affront. He felt his dignity
struck at almost as if the boys had deliberately
refused to learn. To Sam Archer, moreover, he
owed no favor.</p>

<p>“It’s a slight matter,” pleaded Sam, foolishly,
“and it’s going to keep me from going home. I
got permission from the office three days ago.”</p>

<p>“It is <i>not</i> a slight matter,” declared Mr. Alsop,
sharply. “I beg to differ with you. Neglect of
work is never a slight matter. Permissions from
the office are always provisional. You will come
with the rest. I have no extra time to give you.”</p>

<p>Sam withdrew, crestfallen and indignant. He
understood that he was paying the penalty for the
misunderstanding of the evening before, and also
for the morning’s shock to the teacher’s self-esteem.
The unfairness of it rankled deep. The loss of
thirty-six hours at home, the breaking of the engagement
with his mother, the abandonment of
his plan of reunion with his old mates&mdash;all counted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
as nothing in the balance when weighed against
Mr. Alsop’s five minutes and ruffled dignity. The
worst of it was the fact that there was no appeal.
The principal was away on leave of absence for
six months. Every teacher was autocrat in his
own courses. To resist would be to collide with
the whole machinery of government of an institution
which prided itself on expelling annually
more boys than any other school in the land.
Between enduring in silence, and resorting to entreaties
and flattery,&mdash;the only alternatives,&mdash;Sam
did not hesitate a moment. The one he could
bear, the other he would not stoop to.</p>

<p>On the way down to the telegraph office, where
he sent a brief message to his mother, announcing
that he could not get away, Sam drew an angry
comparison between Mr. Alsop’s methods and those
of certain other instructors: Dr. Leighton in Greek
had discovered his pupil’s weakness on the verb
and offered to give special help at any time the
boy chose to call at his room; Mr. Howe in mathematics,
finding him well advanced in geometry
and algebra, had voluntarily suggested that he
slight those subjects and apply the time thus gained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
where it was more needed; Professor Towle in English
roughed him in the class when he got things
wrong, but Towle had a heart of gold and was square
as a brick. On the way back he dwelt on Mulcahy’s
treacherous selfishness of the evening before, which
had set Mr. Alsop against him and had made him
forget that wretched vocabulary. “There’s one
consolation,” he muttered to himself. “I shan’t
have to take him home with me now.”</p>

<p>But Mulcahy had no wish to be cheated of his
visit to the Archers. “I’ll fix that up,” he promised
eagerly, when Sam informed him of the change
of plan. “Let me go and see Alsop. I’ll tell him
a yarn that’ll bring him round in five minutes.”</p>

<p>“What yarn?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know; any old thing that’ll go&mdash;something
about a family party, or your mother’s
being sick and sending for you and your being so
overcome by losing his respect that you didn’t
dare explain. It’ll be dead easy.”</p>

<p>“Easy or not, you won’t do it!” replied Archer,
savagely. “I won’t have any one sucking round
Alsop for me. You’ve told him lies enough, as
it is.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool!” said Mulcahy, sharply.
“Don’t you want to go?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. I did, but I don’t want to any
more.”</p>

<p>Mulcahy, disappointed here, had other forms of
amusement. That afternoon Sam dropped in at
the Sedgwicks’ to call, and allowed himself to be
persuaded to stay to dinner, at which meal he
proved to his own satisfaction that the disasters
of the day had not affected his appetite. Afterward
he lingered in the society of Mrs. Sedgwick
and Miss Margaret as long as it seemed decent,
and departed for his room reasonably comforted in
mind. As he crossed the street, in the rear of the
Academy buildings, two familiar figures appeared
opposite him under a gaslight and got away
quickly into the darkness. They were John Fish
and Mulcahy, each with an overcoat on his arm.</p>

<p>The next day John Fish was at church, wedged
into the corner of a pew. He slept during most
of the service. Mulcahy stayed in his room; his
report next day informed the authorities that he
had been suffering from an attack of indigestion.
Fish took a long nap in the afternoon. He told
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Mr. Alsop, as they walked to dinner together,
that he liked to pass Sunday quietly. Mulcahy
was well enough to be present at the Christian
Fraternity in the evening.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="medium">THE CHALLENGE</span></h2>

<p>The Christmas vacation brought Sam a chance
to consider his school experiences away from the
school atmosphere. He did this in part deliberately,
in part by an unconscious process of comparison
of school standards with home standards,
the hard facts of student life with the fine and
high ideals of his father and mother. Certain
phases of schoolboy morality he talked over with
Mr. Archer, who, pleased to receive the confidence
of his son, met frankness with frankness and
cleared Sam’s mind of many a harassing doubt.
The quiet trust of his parents braced the boy
strongly against the influence of evil.</p>

<p>Sam went back to school resolved that if he
could not have the intimacy of the best he would
at least not associate with the worst; if he could
not be popular with those whom he respected, he
would not seek the favor of those whom he could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
not respect. He was convinced that he was not
marked for great distinction in his school career.
He might, by keeping eternally at it, in course
of time make a fair showing as a hurdler; he could
always get good marks in mathematics and history;
he could maintain friendly relations with
a good many fellows. More than this, however,
was not to be hoped for. He could not, if he
would, go on a still-hunt for honors after the calculating
fashion with which Mulcahy was scheming
to gain possession of the Yale Cup. He was not
made that way.</p>

<p>The work of the winter was for Sam uneventful
and plodding. He toiled with sullen aversion
on his French, with devotion on his Greek, with
calm satisfaction on his mathematics and history,
with resignation on his other subjects. In the
gymnasium he practised pole-vaulting; and on the
wooden track outside, with Collins’s assistance, he
struggled with dashes and starts and hurdles, and
met discouragement with a laugh. He managed
also to find free intervals for a little reading.
On the whole the laborious life proved not unpleasant,
and time slipped rapidly away.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>Besides himself, Jones and Mulcahy were the
chief exponents of the art of pole-vaulting. Jones
was the star of the school, brilliant and unapproachable.
He could do ten feet whenever he wanted
to, and was deemed capable of very much better
performances. Mulcahy started with nine feet,
and Sam with eight feet six. After a month’s
work, Mulcahy had climbed to nine three and
Sam to nine feet. They practised at different
times, but each listened greedily to reports of the
other’s progress, and while openly depreciating
his own powers, hoped from day to day to discover
the precious knack of combining spring and
throw, which would put him well ahead of his
rival. Mulcahy was handicapped by his weight,
Sam by his length and slowness.</p>

<p>The intimacy between the two was lapsing.
The process was slow, because Sam was too good-natured
to quarrel openly and Mulcahy too thick-skinned
to be sensitive to ordinary chilliness of
treatment. Sam put himself to some inconvenience
to be absent from his room when he thought
Mulcahy might call; he likewise cultivated a
friendship with Kendrick, whom Mulcahy disliked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
In time Mulcahy awoke to the fact that
Archer’s neglect was intentional, and accepted the
rebuff as he would have accepted the final refusal
of an expected purchaser to take a book. While
there was no open break between them, Sam
shrewdly suspected that to reject Mulcahy as a
friend was to invite him as an enemy.</p>

<p>“Where’s your friend Mulcahy these days?”
Peck asked, one evening early in February. “You
don’t seem to be so thick with him as you were
a while ago.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Sam, indifferently. “I don’t
seem to be.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” pursued Peck. “Been
scrapping?”</p>

<p>“No. We just don’t see as much of each other
as we used to.”</p>

<p>Duncan fidgeted about a little, and then blurted
out, “Of course it’s none of my business,&mdash;except
as I’ve a little claim in the room and have some
interest in knowing whom I’m likely to find here,&mdash;but
I’d really like to be told whether you’re
just taking a vacation from him or have got
through with him for good.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’m through with him for good,”
confessed Sam.</p>

<p>Duncan’s face broke into a smile. “Glad to
hear it! Only you ought to have done it long
ago. When you ran up against him in the pole-vault,
you probably began to see what sort of a
fellow he is.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t run up against him in the pole-vault,”
replied Sam. “We don’t practise together. It
was something that happened last term that
opened my eyes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was!” said Peck, in a tone between a
question and an exclamation. He waited a little
to see whether Archer was going to explain,
but as Sam volunteered no information, he
continued: “It’s about time for me to begin
to work, if I’m going to pass off those exams in
June. I couldn’t study here with that fellow
hanging round.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry if I drove you out,” said Sam, rather
stiffly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. I didn’t have to go unless
I wanted to, and you had just as good a right to
have your friends round as I did to have mine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
I couldn’t really expect you to take up all my
prejudices.”</p>

<p>“There was prejudice all round, I’m afraid,”
responded Sam. “I had my share. I thought
you were down on Mulcahy just because he was a
poor fellow who was pushing his way up, and it
made me so mad I couldn’t see anything wrong
with him. It wasn’t till after he’d played me a
dirty trick with Alsop that my eyes began to open.
Then I thought it all over during vacation, and
made up my mind that he wasn’t a safe person
to fool with.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear anything about any trouble
with Alsop,” said Duncan, with evident curiosity.</p>

<p>Sam saw that he was committed, and told his
tale. Peck listened with deep interest and frequent
exclamations. “I don’t think I should
have taken that as sweetly as you did,” he said
at length. “No fellow has a right to put you
in that position. Why didn’t you say: ‘Mr. Alsop,
I told you the truth. I don’t smoke,’ and let
Mulcahy get out of it as well as he could?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t like to do that,” replied Sam. “It
didn’t seem honorable.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know but you’re right,” said Duncan,
thoughtfully. “You couldn’t play the mucker because
he did. It wouldn’t have done any good,
either. He’d have lied you right down.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so. I couldn’t think of anything to
say that wouldn’t make it worse.”</p>

<p>Duncan nodded agreement. “I suppose it
would. You’ve got a lot more sense than I
thought you had.”</p>

<p>Sam smiled grimly at the dubious compliment.</p>

<p>“Look here,” went on Duncan, taking up a
brown-covered book from the table. “You’re
a shark in geometry, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I got B plus for a term mark,” said Sam,
complacently.</p>

<p>“Well, I wish you’d explain this formula.
I can understand equation 3, but how you get
5 from it, as the book says, is beyond me.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t a difficult thing to explain, nor was
Duncan as stupid about geometry as he thought
himself. Sam turned the clean white pages of
the book.</p>

<p>“New?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” ejaculated Duncan, with indignant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
emphasis, “the third I’ve had this year. It’s a
scandal the way books disappear in this school.
You might as well throw ’em away as leave
’em out on the hall racks. The last one I had,
I put my initials in at the bottom of the next to
the last page. If you ever see a book with ‘D. P.’
in it, confiscate it&mdash;it’s mine.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Duncan stopped that afternoon for a few minutes
at the room of Fuzzy Woods in Odlin House.</p>

<p>“How’s Shirley?” he asked in the course of
gossip. “Done anything queer lately?”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” drawled Woods. “He’s got
two or three duels on.”</p>

<p>Duncan giggled. “What for?&mdash;insults?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Woods. “It’s always for
insults.”</p>

<p>“Will they fight?”</p>

<p>“Naw, the duels never come off&mdash;at least
none has so far. They think it’s a great joke till
he gets fierce as a pirate and asks ’em which
they’ll take, swords or pistols. Then most of
’em try to sneak out of it. He told Lauter he’d
shoot him anyway, and scared the life out of him.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>“Has he challenged you?”</p>

<p>“Naw, I let him alone.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the fellow?”</p>

<p>“He was in school a long time in France and
Switzerland; he got a lot of crazy ideas there about
honor and insults and settling things by duels.”</p>

<p>“Can he really fence?” questioned Duncan.</p>

<p>“How should I know!” answered Fuzzy, indifferently.</p>

<p>Just then some one knocked and was yelled at
to come in. It proved to be Shirley himself, a
slender, well-groomed boy with an English accent,
who had come to borrow a translation. On
Woods’s invitation he stayed. Duncan fell to
asking him questions about foreign schools and
schoolboys. The two got on finely until Duncan
wanted to know what kind of athletics they had
in these foreign places, and Shirley confessed
that there were no regular sports.</p>

<p>“What do they do for exercise?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they walk and fence and play tennis a
little.”</p>

<p>“No track athletics, or football, or baseball, or
rowing?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>“No. Football wouldn’t be allowed.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a gentleman’s game.”</p>

<p>Duncan sniffed. “It isn’t a lady’s game.
Don’t they even have cricket?”</p>

<p>“No, they don’t know any more about cricket
than they do about baseball.”</p>

<p>“I suppose they all go to walk two and two, like
the girls in a convent. They must be a choice
lot of little mollycoddles!”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t advise you to call one of them by
that name!” declared Shirley, warming up.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“You’d have a duel on your hands.”</p>

<p>“Rats!” said Duncan, contemptuously. “No
one but a barbarian fights duels these days.”</p>

<p>“That shows how little you know about it,”
said Shirley, stiffly.</p>

<p>“Would you fight a duel?” demanded Peck.</p>

<p>“Certainly, if honor demanded it.”</p>

<p>“Then you’d be a barbarian. Don’t you think
so, Fuzzy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think anything about it,” answered
Woods, who had been vainly trying to catch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
Duncan’s eye and warn him that he was entering
dangerous ground.</p>

<p>“Half barbarian and half fool,” continued Peck.</p>

<p>Shirley rose and stood erect, gazing straight
at the visitor, with indignant eyes and reddening
cheeks.</p>

<p>“I am not used to being called a fool!” he said
solemnly.</p>

<p>“Who called you a fool?” asked Duncan,
coolly. “I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“You said a man who would fight a duel was a
fool and a barbarian,” repeated Shirley.</p>

<p>“Half a fool and half a barbarian,” corrected
Peck.</p>

<p>“But I said that I would fight a duel.”</p>

<p>“Then you must be it,” asserted Duncan, with
nonchalance, stretching himself out in his chair
and putting his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>“Those are insulting words to apply to a gentleman.
You will take them back!” cried Shirley,
hotly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t apply them&mdash;just made a general
statement. You took ’em yourself. Perhaps you
felt they fitted.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<p>“That’s quite enough!” said Shirley, slowly,
taking a step forward. “It’s evident that you
mean to insult me. We will settle the point of
honor in a gentleman’s way. Name your weapons
and the place of meeting. Shall it be swords or
pistols? The choice is yours.”

<span class="medium">AN AFFAIR OF HONOR</span></h2>

<p>“Swords or pistols!” echoed Duncan, sufficiently
aroused to sit up in his chair. “What
have swords and pistols to do with it?”</p>

<p>“They are the recognized weapons for settling
affairs of honor. Perhaps you were ignorant
of the fact.” Shirley spoke with scornful dignity.</p>

<p>“This isn’t an affair of honor, it’s a mere difference
of opinion,” protested Duncan. “You
wouldn’t fight over that, I hope.”</p>

<p>“I’d fight over insults!”</p>

<p>Duncan laughed aloud, reckless of the fact that
his laugh added to the affront.</p>

<p>“What good does fighting do? If you should
wound me with a sword, it wouldn’t make the
truth of what I said any less true, and if I should
put a bullet into you, it wouldn’t drive out the
insult. I say that the man who fights duels is a
barbarian. If I fight, I make myself a barbarian.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p>“Swords or pistols!” insisted Shirley, with a
dogged indifference to logic.</p>

<p>“Neither,” answered Peck.</p>

<p>“Then you are not a gentleman, and are a
coward. You have my contempt.”</p>

<p>“Hold on there!” exclaimed Peck, dropping his
smile and his air of pleasantry. “Who’s calling
names now?”</p>

<p>“They are names usually applied to a man who
insults you and won’t give you satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“If you think I owe you satisfaction for our
difference of opinion, you must owe me something
for calling me a contemptible coward,” announced
Duncan, in serious tones. “I’ll propose&mdash;” he
hesitated, and approached a step nearer Shirley;
“I’ll propose bowie-knives!”</p>

<p>Shirley recoiled. “I am not used to bowie-knives.”</p>

<p>“Nor I to swords and pistols,” said Duncan.</p>

<p>The fairness of this answer appealed to the
man of honor. “Then we must find some other
way,” he said. “Insults can only be wiped out
with blood. We’ll play chess, and the one who’s
beaten will commit suicide.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>At this proposition Duncan stared hard. For
a moment he harbored the suspicion that Shirley
was chaffing him, not he Shirley. But the boy’s
solemn face and tragic manner immediately dispelled
this illusion.</p>

<p>“I don’t play chess,” Duncan answered with
plausible earnestness. “Let’s make it golf, and
leave to the one who’s defeated the option of
committing suicide or not. We can consider
him dead anyway.”</p>

<p>“I don’t play golf.”</p>

<p>At this point Woods, seeing a chance to bring
the deadly affair to a bloodless conclusion, interrupted
with a shrewd proposal.</p>

<p>“Why not run it off? Both of you can run.
Make the course a certain number of times round
the wooden track, and let the fellow that’s beaten
set up fudges and stuff for the principals and
seconds. I call that a very honorable arrangement.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t quite regular,” remarked Shirley,
doubtfully. “Properly there ought to be some
blood shed.”</p>

<p>“If I’m beaten, I’ll apologize,” said Duncan.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
“How does that strike you? I suppose on a
pinch I might produce a little blood. I don’t
want to neglect any formalities.”</p>

<p>“I think I can accept without that,” said
Shirley, with magnanimity.</p>

<p>“The one that’s beaten sets up for the crowd;
don’t forget that!” Woods interposed. “Whose
second am I going to be?”</p>

<p>“You can have him and I’ll get some one else,
or I’ll take him and you can have some one else.”
Duncan was truly generous.</p>

<p>“I’ll take him,” said Shirley.</p>

<p>“Then, sir, I will send my second to wait upon
yours and arrange for the details of the combat.
I have the honor, sir, to wish you good afternoon.
We shall meet again!” This grand peroration
safely and pompously delivered, Duncan stalked
solemnly away.</p>

<p>So much time had been consumed in this highly
interesting interview with Shirley that Duncan
postponed until after recitation the pleasure of
retailing the whole story to Bruce, and giving
him the chance to act as second. On the way
home he remembered that Bruce was to be in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
Boston the following day, but this did not dampen
his spirits. Seconds for such an occasion could
be obtained by the squad. He flew upstairs to
his room chuckling and stumbling, nodded absently
to Archer, who was moping over a Greek
lesson, and took up an algebra with the intention
of utilizing the fifteen minutes remaining
to gain some idea of the methods of the review
chapter which was the lesson for the
four-o’clock flunkers’ class. Through the carelessness
of inattention he ran on a snag in the
first explanation, and had to call on his room-mate
to help him off. Then he worked out two
problems near the beginning and one near the
end of the exercise, threw the book on the
table, looked at his watch, rose, stretched, and
burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>“I never saw anything so funny as that in the
algebra,” remarked Sam, observing his merry
room-mate over his reading glasses.</p>

<p>“It isn’t in the algebra, it isn’t in any book,”
cried Duncan, gleefully. “Nothing like it ever
happens in a book. I’m engaged in an affair of
honor; I’m going to fight a duel!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>“A duel!” exclaimed Sam, aghast. “With
whom?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a fellow you don’t know, in Odlin House.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, on the running track behind the
gym. Will you be my second?”</p>

<p>The invitation was due to a momentary impulse
of friendliness. Archer was a track expert and a
decent fellow; why not let him in?</p>

<p>Duncan stood with hands in trousers pockets,
smiling roguishly and watching the expression on
Archer’s face. Appalled by the grim picture
called up by the word “duel,” and puzzled to
reconcile this conception with Peck’s evident
gayety, Sam knew not whether to accept or refuse.
Then there recurred to his mind the serious incident
of the last term, when Kendrick had sprung
instantly to his help, and he answered in Kendrick’s
own words, “Sure I will!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Peck. “There’ll be no
end of sport. You see&mdash;oh, hang that bell!&mdash;I’ll
tell you all about it after class.”</p>

<p>At half-past two the next afternoon, when the
outskirts of the gymnasium were clear of idlers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
the duel was fought. It was agreed that Archer
should be starter and Woods judge at the finish;
the course was three times round the track.
Shirley took the lead at the start, running in quick,
short steps, with Peck pounding away in eager
strides behind him. Shirley tripped past the judge
on the first lap, ten yards ahead of his pursuer, and
went pattering around the curve and up the back
stretch as if his legs were driven by a gasoline
engine. At the lower end, however, his pace began
to tell upon him; the pat-pat of the striking soles
became slower, the steps shorter. Duncan perceived
that the time for his spurt had come, but
he was twelve yards behind when he crossed the
line the second time.</p>

<p>The third lap proved fierce beyond all expectation.
Shirley, game to the last, clenched his fists
and lashed himself on. Duncan, stung by the
fear of an ignominious end to his adventure,
plying his legs to the limit of his strength, with
dry mouth and dizzy head panted after his rival.
He gained but slowly. On the back stretch he
was still five yards behind. As they came down
toward the finish line, two wobbly, tottering figures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
with set eyes and strained, twisted features,
one close to the shoulder of the other, Sam,
seized with the fear that both would drop before
the finish, reached forward eagerly to catch Duncan
as he touched the line. Duncan, keeping his
feet to the end, plunged helplessly into Sam’s
arms. At the same time Woods received the
quivering, gasping Shirley, who lay upon him for
a few seconds, an inert dead weight. Presently
Shirley opened his eyes and looked up. “Who&mdash;won?”
he breathed rather than spoke.</p>

<p>“I’m blest if I know!” answered Woods. “I
forgot to see. Who got it, Archer?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice,” said Sam. “It wasn’t my
business to judge the finish. I was getting ready
to catch this fellow.”</p>

<p>“They were right together anyway. We’ll
have to call it a tie,” decided the judge.</p>

<p>“That means we don’t get anything,” observed
Archer.</p>

<p>“We’ll run it&mdash;over again&mdash;” panted Shirley,
over his shoulder, as Woods led him away to the
gymnasium.</p>

<p>“No, we won’t!” whispered Duncan in a broken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
undertone into his second’s ear. “I’d rather take
my chances with swords or pistols. Catch me
running any more races without training. I’ll
bet we made a new record.”</p>

<p>It developed in the course of the afternoon
that there had been unseen witnesses of the spectacle,
and these witnesses not only spread highly
colored versions of what they had seen, but also
asked rude, saucy questions of the actors. The
fellows in Odlin House cleverly pried certain admissions
out of Shirley, guessed at what they did
not know, and put in circulation a tale which was
received with greedy ears and grinning faces.
Duncan bounced into 7 Hale in the middle of the
evening and planted himself, an outraged victim
of treachery, before Archer’s chair.</p>

<p>“What did you want to go and blab all this thing
for?” he began, glowering fiercely at his room-mate’s
startled face.</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” replied Sam, quickly. “I haven’t
said a word about it.”</p>

<p>“It’s all over school. Some one’s been giving
it away. They say it was you.”</p>

<p>Sam tossed his book upon the table with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
spiteful jerk. “They lie, then. I haven’t even
told who won the race. I’ve referred every single
fellow to you.”</p>

<p>Duncan’s wrath gave way to gloom. “Some
one’s done it, anyway. They’re all joshing me
about it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help that,” said Sam. “What do you
care? Laugh it off.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been laughing it off. I’ve laughed till
my face aches, but that doesn’t make me any
happier. Do you know, I could have sworn I
was ahead of that fellow at the finish. Why
didn’t you keep your eyes open?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of you, not of the race.
You looked as if you were all in, ten feet before
you got to me. I expected to see you drop.”</p>

<p>Sam waited for Peck to reply, but Peck offered
no comment.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact,” continued Sam, frankly,
“the last time I <i>did</i> notice your positions, Shirley
was a good yard ahead.”</p>

<p>“I’m dead sure I beat him at the finish,” said
Duncan, obstinately. “I wish I’d had Bruce
there!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="medium">SAM’S FIRST RACE</span></h2>

<p>One result of the Shirley-Peck duel was to check
the developing friendship of the inmates of 7 Hale.
Duncan felt that Archer ought to have been on
the watch when he passed Shirley at the finish&mdash;he
took most indignantly the suggestion that Shirley
was really ahead after all. Sam, having performed
his part to the best of his ability, was disgusted
with the childish obstinacy with which
Duncan cherished his sense of injury. Coldness
again marked the relations of the room-mates.</p>

<p>Another consequence of the bloody fray was
the appearance of Shirley among the track men.
Bruce got him out&mdash;no one could long resist the
spell of Bruce’s winning manner&mdash;and Collins
appointed him his proper task. They tried him at
first on the longer stretches, but six hundred yards
and even three hundred were soon found to be distances
for which Shirley’s quick stride was not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
adapted. Then Collins set him to sprinting,
and rubbed his hands with delight over the result.
“Frenchie” took to starting and sprinting as a
hound to a rabbit trail. In a week his starts were
instantaneous, and his legs twinkled along the
forty yards like the feet of a running mouse. Duncan
was out too for the three hundred, and doing
well, his friends said, though with old Chouder in
the event, second place was the best he could
hope for.</p>

<p>Mulcahy’s attitude toward Sam was changing.
There had been no outward break in their relations,
but Mulcahy had become distant in his greeting,
and only showed his old cordiality when he had
some special object to attain. He was busy now
with what Duncan called “a new graft”&mdash;getting
members for the Harvard Club, of which he was
secretary and treasurer. Every boy who was preparing
for Harvard was pressed to join in order
to prove his loyalty. Every new member paid
one dollar for a printed shingle signed by the secretary.
The club had no meetings, except to elect
officers and to be photographed. It had no
expenses except the price of the shingle plate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
with fifty cheap prints, and the cost of inserting a
group photograph in the school Annual.</p>

<p>“Easy money!” said Duncan in disgust, when
Sam reported that he had joined. “He’s got my
dollar too.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think he keeps the money, do
you?” asked Sam, surprised at the implied
charge.</p>

<p>“You don’t think he gives it back, do you?”
retorted Duncan.</p>

<p>“No, but there must be miscellaneous expenses.”</p>

<p>“You can call it that if you want to. The
account stands something like this: twenty-five
shingles sold to new members at a dollar each,
twenty-five dollars; twenty-five shingles bought
at a dime each, two-fifty; picture in the Annual,
five; miscellaneous, seventeen-fifty; balance in
treasury at the beginning of next year, nothing.
Conundrum: who got the seventeen-fifty? Your
friend Mulcahy is a slick one!”</p>

<p>“He isn’t my friend!” declared Sam, stoutly.</p>

<p>“He is if he can get anything out of you; if he
can’t, he’s your enemy.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>Vexed at the slur at his simplicity implied in
Duncan’s words, yet half inclined to acknowledge
that the senior was right, Sam took his geometry
and departed for the Academy. It lacked still
fifteen minutes to the time for recitation, but he
hoped to find among the few steadies who often
came early either Phipps or Entstein, the sharks
of the section, and get an idea from one of them as
to the last original in the lesson. He had solved
four out of the five.</p>

<p>No sooner was he seated at a desk than Mulcahy
came in, glanced round the room, made quick
estimate of the possibilities offered, and slipped
into a seat beside Archer.</p>

<p>“Hello, Archer!” he exclaimed, his voice ringing
with cordiality. “I haven’t seen you for a
week. How’s the pole-vault going?”</p>

<p>“Not very well,” responded Sam, coldly.</p>

<p>“If you’re doing no better than I am, you’re
rotten!” went on Mulcahy, amiably. “I can’t
make nine feet any more&mdash;seem to have lost the
knack. I hear you did nine four the other day.”</p>

<p>“Nine three,” corrected Sam.</p>

<p>“I can’t touch that. I see where I come out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
at the bottom in the Shield Meet. How many
originals did you get to-day?”</p>

<p>“Four.”</p>

<p>“You’re a shark! What kind of figure did you
have for 213?”</p>

<p>Sam opened his papers and showed a neatly
drawn diagram with his proof carefully indicated
beneath. Mulcahy studied it silently for two full
minutes. “That’s the way I did it,” he said. “I
wasn’t sure it was right. Did you get 214?”</p>

<p>Sam handed over another sheet, to which his
companion gave as close a scrutiny as to the first.
“I don’t understand that,” he said, pointing to a
statement. “How do you get that?”</p>

<p>“That’s easy,” replied Sam, proud of his achievement.
“I’ll show you.” He looked about for a
loose sheet of paper.</p>

<p>“Use this,” offered Mulcahy, turning to the
blank page at the end of his book. “I can rub it
out afterward.”</p>

<p>Sam took the geometry and quickly jotted down
on the fly leaf the omitted intermediate steps.
“I see that,” said Mulcahy, and devoted himself
once more to the study of Sam’s diagrams. Sam
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
turned back the leaves of the geometry. On the
margin of the page next to the last he found the
two letters D. P.</p>

<p>This discovery effectually occupied Sam’s mind
during the few minutes that remained before the
recitation bell sounded. His papers went unnoticed
through Mulcahy’s hands. While the
bell was ringing, Mulcahy asked a last question,
and Sam leaned absently toward him to follow
the questioner’s finger upon the page. At this
moment, while their heads were close together,
some one called sharply from the door at their
side, “Archer!”</p>

<p>Sam turned and beheld Duncan Peck grinning
at him in the doorway.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you!” Peck threw at him in a
jeering undertone, and disappeared behind the
entering class.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing I could tell <i>you</i>,” thought
Sam, grimly, as he faced front again, “but I
won’t. You can find your missing books yourself!”</p>

<p>When the instructor asked how many had succeeded
in proving the whole five originals, Phipps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
alone put up his hand. Three, including Archer
and Mulcahy, averred that they could do four.
Others professed three and two and one, and some
none at all. Mulcahy was sent to the board and
returned in triumph, sure of a good mark for the
recitation. He had made excellent use of Archer’s
solution. Sam was not called on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To the blas&eacute; attendant from the town, the Faculty
Shield Meet of that year would have seemed
little different from a dozen other events of the kind
which he had witnessed. Collins and Bruce, testing
it by a standard of their own, called it satisfactory.
The old boys who came back from the
colleges in fine attire to act as judges spoke of it
with patronizing interest as a success. For two
contestants, at least, it was the most important
event that the school year had as yet developed.
Shirley, the duellist, won his trial heat in the
forty yards, though some derisive remarks were
made about him as he crouched on the starting
line. These remarks ceased when he took his
second heat, an easy yard ahead of his nearest
rival. In the third heat he was again the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
leader. In the final he was matched against
Gay, the best hundred-yards man in school.</p>

<p>Sam and Taylor stood together near the finish
line.</p>

<p>“I wish Shirley would beat that Gay, even if
Gay does belong to my class,” remarked Taylor,
maliciously. “Since he won the hundred last
year at Hillbury, he wears a hat four sizes bigger.
I don’t suppose there’s any chance for Frenchie.”</p>

<p>“Lots of chance,” returned Archer, wisely.
“Shirley strikes his stride in the very first yard.
He may get put back, of course.”</p>

<p>There was a false start, but it was Gay who went
back a foot; another, and Fairmount joined him.
All four hung on the next set, and the pistol
cracked. While the others were still rising, Shirley
was shooting forward with his feet well under him.
He was a yard ahead at the end of ten yards; at
the forty no one was within five feet of him.</p>

<p>“Bully for Frenchie!” cried Taylor. “That’ll
take down the swelling on Gay’s head an inch
or two. What’s the time? Four and three-fifths?
Why, that’s the record!” And Taylor
ran off to have a hand in the boisterous congratulations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
which the lower middlers were lavishing on
their unexpected champion.</p>

<p>Sam was on his way to the starting line for
the forty-five-yard hurdles. He had no chance
against Fairmount, he knew well, but Fairmount
was not in his heat, and he hoped to survive the
first trial at any rate. If he could only get his
long legs to swinging faster! He crouched for his
start, a little white around the lips, but cool,
waited while Somers was put back, and got off
reasonably well. Somers was ahead of him at the
second hurdle, but he caught him on the third, and
breasted the tape a foot ahead. In the finals,
Fairmount was outside him and Edmands and
Foote inside. This time he was slower. All three
got off before him, but Foote stumbled at the first
hurdle and fell behind. Edmands he overtook
as he passed the second. Together they ran for
the third, but Archer cleared with less waste of
time, and was close behind Fairmount at the finish.
It was not victory, but he was fully satisfied with
second place.</p>

<p>After that Sam had nothing to do but sit content
in his warm bathrobe and watch the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
races. Bruce, of course, took the six hundred
yards, and Weatherford the thousand, both veterans
who surprised no one. Then old Chouder’s
race, the three hundred, was called. Duncan was
in the pack that chased at Chouder’s heels, gradually
scattering behind as the pace told. Duncan
was not the last by any means, nor quick-stepping
Shirley, who held the pole behind the leader, and
after gaining fifteen yards on the first round, kept
himself in the van during the second. Both Peck
and Richmond spurted to pass him on the final
stretch, but neither could quite reach him. Shirley
fell across the line two feet behind Chouder,
with Peck a yard farther back.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he’ll say now!” thought Sam,
gleefully. “He can’t pretend he beat Frenchie
this time!”</p>

<p>But alas! Sam’s complacency was soon to receive
a shock. In the indoor pole-vault, which
Jones won at ten feet four amid great applause,
Archer did his expected nine feet three. Mulcahy,
however, who had pretended two days
before that he could no longer reach nine feet,
vaulted nine six with ease! And when Sam taxed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
him with the inconsistency of his words and his
performance, he smiled contemptuously, and
“guessed he had got back his form!”</p>

<p>That night Sam waited a sleepy hour beyond his
bedtime to catch Peck, who spent the evening out.</p>

<p>“What about Shirley now?” he demanded,
as soon as the door was closed behind the truant.</p>

<p>“He can run,” answered Duncan, coolly.</p>

<p>“He licked you to-day, right and good, didn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did,” conceded Duncan.</p>

<p>“What about the day of the duel,” pursued
Sam. “Didn’t he beat you then, too?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he did and perhaps he didn’t. Who
can tell?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t so far out, anyway,” growled Sam.
And Duncan thought so too, but not being wholly
ready to acknowledge the error, he deferred his
admission to a later time.

<span class="medium">HE TRIES AGAIN</span></h2>

<p>On the Saturday after the Faculty Shield day,
Sam ran in the forty-five-yard hurdles again, in
the handicap meet which regularly follows the
scratch contests. The handicapper thought one
yard about the right allowance for the long-legged
upper middler; Somers got two and Foote three.
Fairmount ran from scratch. It was a hot race,
with every contestant hoping to cross the line first,
the man in front driving himself that his advantage
might not be wrested from him, the pursuers
confident of superiority and struggling to secure
the positions which belonged to them. Sam felt
the presence of Somers and Foote ahead pulling
him forward as the magnet attracts steel; his legs
followed each other faster than they had ever
gone before; the three hurdles were but three
exhilarating bounds in his course. Forgetting
Fairmount, who was behind, he ran down Somers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
pressed on after Foote, and passed him by a
convulsive straining effort at the finish. Never
before had he felt what it was to <i>fight</i> his way in a
race; to mark his adversary and beat him, as one
throws his opponent in a wrestling bout, or as the
tackier downs his man, surely and hard, on the
football field. In his struggle to pass Foote he
had kept ahead of Fairmount, who finished two
feet behind him.</p>

<p>Collins was pleased, as much with the new spirit
of the hurdler as with his success in the event.
“He’s slow,” he remarked to Bruce, “but he’ll
come in time.”</p>

<p>“This year?” questioned Bruce, closely. It was
“this year,” the year of his captaincy, that interested
Bruce.</p>

<p>“I can’t say,” answered Collins, thoughtfully.
“It may take a long while. He’s a good, steady
boy; he’ll come all right sometime.”</p>

<p>Duncan Peck, too, seemed to be influenced by
Sam’s modest success in the handicap meeting.
He confessed one day in a burst of confidence,
after Sam had led him through the maze of a foolish
algebra problem about two men who rowed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
past each other up and down stream&mdash;each,
apparently, with a stop watch and a log line&mdash;that
his duel joke with Shirley had proved a boomerang.
In return Sam told him of the initials&mdash;D.
P.&mdash;in the back of Mulcahy’s book.</p>

<p>“It’s mine all right,” remarked Duncan, “but
I’ve got another now, and it isn’t worth while to
make a row about it. I can’t prove anything
against him. He’d say he bought it at Moran’s
or of one of those fellows who were fired last week.
It shows you what he is, though.”</p>

<p>“I know what he is,” said Sam, blushing.
“I don’t need any more lessons.”</p>

<p>Another person with whom Sam hoped that he
might gain some influence by the prestige of his
improvement in the hurdles was his second cousin,
Wally Sedgwick. Wally was a lower middler,
active-minded and ambitious. Athletics would
have given a natural scope to his energy, but he
was too small and immature to have any chance in
Seaton sports. He had fallen in with a set of idle
boys of not the highest standards, who appealed
to Wally’s imagination as gay young bloods; they
knew things and were up to date. None of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
was in the class of John Fish, a reprobate, and
callous to the opinion of his associates; nor in
that of Mulcahy, whose ambition led him to conceal
his wrong-doing, but could not prevent his
determined selfishness from pushing to the surface.
The wickedness of Wally’s friends lay mainly
in talk and swagger, but they had already suggested
to him that the code of morals taught in his
home was goody-goody, and that the proper way
to show his spirit was to do “what everybody
did.” Wally was popular with many of the older
boys because he was the brother of Margaret
Sedgwick. They bestowed attentions on him in
the hope of “making themselves solid” with Miss
Margaret, caring little whether these attentions
were good for the boy or not.</p>

<p>The track team were going to Boston to compete
in the schoolboy games of the Boston Athletic
Association. For the first time in his school career
Sam was to be a member of a Seaton team in contest
with other schools. He was to wear the significant
red letters on his shirt, was to see his name
on the big official programme as a representative
of Seaton, was to be trusted to do a part in gaining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
public honors for the school. He thought of it
by day, dreamed of it by night, and longed, as
only an inexperienced tyro can long, to do credit
to those who trusted him. Mr. Archer, who
sympathized with his son in all innocent interests,
that he might wield the stronger influence when
great questions of conduct came up for settlement,
ordered a ticket and promised to be present at
the contests. Sam wrote the usual disclaimer of
any expectation of getting a place, but his secret
hopes ran high. Why shouldn’t Fairmount win
first and he second, as they had done at Seaton?</p>

<p>Then came the trip in pleasant but orderly company,
the lunch in town, the dressing in confused,
cramped quarters, the facing of tier on tier of partisans
encircling the huge room, the disorderly
jumble about the starting lines, the hurried calling
of contestants, the uproar of rival cheers&mdash;and at
last the all-important summons. Few looked
upon that particular heat of the forty-five-yard
hurdles with special interest. Occasional friends
of runners scattered through the benches, Mr.
Archer straining his eyes at the long, lank figure
crouching in the outside course, Collins ever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
calmly observant of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, the little batch
of eager Seatonians watching the red letters, a
noisy squad cheering the wearer of a big W&mdash;these
were the real audience.</p>

<p>The pistol cracked. The line shot forward,
over hurdles, through hurdles, stampeding for
the tape. Sam stumbled, caught his step again
and dashed blindly on. He sprang for the last
hurdle as another was leaving it. A blue N
was first, the W second, Sam an unplaced third.
The starters were calling the sixth heat.</p>

<p>It was all over in ten seconds&mdash;the set, the
start, the struggle, the finish, Sam’s dream of
achievement. He slipped into a corner by his
schoolmates and tried to forget his disappointment
in watching the efforts of his friends. He
saw Kilham of Hillbury beat out Fairmount by
a foot in the finals of the hurdles. He cheered
vigorously when Gay took the forty. He groaned
in dismay as Bruce was pocketed on the curve
of the track in the six hundred and forced behind.
When Weatherford won the thousand yards and
Brewster the mile, and Jones soared a handbreadth
above the bar after all rivals had failed, he exulted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
with pure delight. At such times the sight of the
success of his school almost comforted him for
his own failure. But when unfamiliar letters
were in the van, when the Seaton runners were
lost in the field of pursuers, then the fruitlessness
of his own effort recurred to him afresh, and the
folly of his hopes. Abashed, he glanced up at the
indistinct face in the distant gallery and wondered
whether his father felt himself the victim of false
representations. Exactly what his father did
think he had no opportunity to discover. When
Sam looked for him after the pole-vault, his place
was empty; Mr. Archer, having stayed to the
limit of his time, was hurrying for his train.</p>

<p>The next day Sam approached the groups of
chattering acquaintances with some dread of
sarcastic comment. His fears were needless.
Kendrick and Taylor and a few others remarked
sympathetically on his “hard luck”; Duncan
Peck made a creditable effort to be encouraging;
but the majority showed no concern whatever
in his failure. This contemptuous indifference
on the part of the many, this assumption that he
didn’t count or that nothing was expected of him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
anyway, stirred Sam’s fighting blood. He did
not need the consolation which Collins gave when
he spoke of the event as “just practice,” nor the
inspiration of Bruce’s gay derision of himself
for being blocked off on the track. The public
disdain was stimulus enough to a proud spirit.
Sam’s resolution to brook no discouragement
until time had fully proved his incompetency
dates from that day.</p>

<p>But there were other interests in Sam’s daily
life besides hurdling. His lessons were going,
some well, some tolerably, some ill. In French
he did not get ahead, and consequently he did
not gain in favor with Mr. Alsop. In truth, it is
to be feared that Sam did not try his very best
for the lord of his entry. The experienced had
informed him that if one did well enough with
two or three teachers to make himself solid with
them, they would defend him against those with
whom he did ill. As Sam’s schedule was a full
one and some neglect was inevitable, he followed
his inclination and neglected Mr. Alsop. That
gentleman did not relish neglect; it offended his
dignity and cut through the smooth coating of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
self-satisfaction. Mr. Alsop would never have
struck an enemy whose hands were bound, but
he did not hesitate to assail in the classroom with
personal flings and stinging sarcasms the luckless
boy who incurred his displeasure. Unable to
strike back, the boy endured in silence and nursed
his sense of unjust treatment with sullen, unforgiving
wrath. Mr. Alsop meant well, but he
lacked the instinct of fairness.</p>

<p>In the dormitory entry there were troubles for
which Sam and Birdie Fowle were generally held
responsible by Mr. Alsop,&mdash;Sam as the accessory
who was too clever to be detected, Birdie as the
criminal occasionally caught in the act. Some
one, supposed to have been Birdie, had thrown
water out of a window in the vain attempt to
reach a boy who was hurling taunts from below.
Mr. Alsop had called up Fowle and charged him
with the offence. Birdie had acknowledged his
sin. The teacher, instead of welcoming this
frankness as an encouraging symptom, and by
tact and kindness inspiring in that careless youth
the desire to keep the peace, read him a harsh
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
to the indignant satisfaction of the boy that the
fellows were right when they said that honesty
was not the best policy in dealing with profs.
Injustice being the rule, one might as well be
actually bad, as good and always suspected of
badness.</p>

<p>Soon after this the day’s collection of waste
paper in the wire grate in the basement was set
on fire, causing small damage, but much excitement
throughout the well and great chagrin to
the official regulator thereof. Fortunately for
Birdie, his presence at recitation at the time
enabled him to prove a complete alibi. Right
upon the heels of this act of vandalism some
miscreant, in the middle of the evening study
hour, set off a cannon cracker in the entry.
Mr. Alsop, who was at home, tore open his door
and rushed savagely up the stairs. Through a
dense cloud of smoke he descried John Fish
standing in his doorway.</p>

<p>“What is it, Fish?” Mr. Alsop demanded angrily.</p>

<p>“Some one’s set off a cannon cracker, sir,”
answered Fish. “I was just coming out to see if
I couldn’t catch the fellow.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>Doors were open now about the stairway,
heads peered over from above.</p>

<p>“Could you tell where it came from?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you have anything to do with it, Booth?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“You, Rand?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“You, Moorhead?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“You, Taylor?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“You, Fish?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Alsop went upstairs, called out every occupant
of every room, and put to all the same
question. Fowle and Archer he asked twice.
Peck was out, and so was Lord’s room-mate.
Otherwise the entire well was canvassed. After
the cross-examination was concluded, the teacher
gathered the whole company into his room.</p>

<p>“Some one has told me a falsehood,” he began
solemnly. “I do not know who it is, but I can
guess. To that person I want to say that I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
consider a lie as much worse than setting off
crackers, as crackers are worse than an ordinary
rough-house. The one who is responsible will
do well to come to me and confess the truth.
The rest of you who are shielding the guilty one
should remember that by keeping silent you assume
a share in the guilt. If I can’t have order
in this well by any other means, I’ll put the whole
well on study hours, and if that doesn’t answer,
it will have to be cleaned out altogether. The
school has no use for rowdies.”</p>

<p>This last threat Mr. Alsop did not really mean,
as it would have involved firing the studious
Moorhead, the good John Fish, and the cherub
Rand,&mdash;the sweetest, most friendly, most diligent
little boy that Mr. Alsop had on his list. But
instances were known of whole dormitory wells
ruthlessly swept clear at an indignation meeting
of an offended faculty. Fowle and Archer as
the scapegoats of the well foresaw trouble for
themselves, at any rate, whatever punishments
were inflicted. They got together soon after
Mr. Alsop’s audience was dismissed, and held
wrathful council. At the end they picked up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
Taylor and moved down on John Fish, who
opened his door a crack to see who was knocking,
and then opened it wide because a big foot
prevented its being closed.</p>

<p>“I’m getting popular,” he said, smiling feebly
at his visitors.</p>

<p>“Not with this gang!” said Taylor, as he shut
the door behind him.</p>

<p>“You set off that cracker!” blurted Sam, with
suppressed fierceness.</p>

<p>“I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“You lie! You did,” retorted Sam. “You
know you did. We want to give you warning that
this funny business has got to stop. You know
that Fowle and I get the credit if anything happens
here, whether we’re in it or not. If we get soaked
by Alsop for anything that’s done hereafter,
we’ll maul you so that you can’t stand!”</p>

<p>Fish looked at the trio in apprehension.
Archer’s fight with Runyon had passed into dormitory
history; he was regarded as a dangerous
man. Fowle and Taylor were solid fellows, the
latter a member of his class football team. Fish
himself, though easily superior to the smaller
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
occupants of the well, would have shrunk from
single combat with any one of the militant trio.
His chance against them all would have been
very poor indeed.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he asked sullenly.</p>

<p>“We want you to cut it out, that’s all,” answered
Fowle.</p>

<p>“Cut it out entirely,” added Taylor.</p>

<p>“Well, I will,” answered Fish, in a sour tone,
“but I can’t be responsible for everything that
happens.”

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="medium">A FOOLHARDY ADVENTURE</span></h2>

<p>The inhabitants of the east well of Hale became
lovers of peace. Mr. Alsop had not full confidence
in the change, scenting something ominous in
the unnatural calm. The rumor that had spread
among his colleagues that Alsop was having a
sad time in his dormitory touched that gentleman
in a sensitive spot. Ability to get on with pupils
is considered a most desirable quality in a teacher,
even in an institution like Seaton, in which the
headsman’s axe is the chief disciplinary weapon,
and the fear of it the great persuader to the quiet
life. Trouble with his boys meant that Mr. Alsop
was not in all respects a success; and the teacher,
while forced to confess this fact to himself, did
not wish it unpleasantly noised abroad. He
was suffering for his own conscientiousness and
keenness of perception; he knew Fowle and
Archer as dangerous boys, while other teachers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
were still dull-witted or misguided enough to
defend them.</p>

<p>One morning, as Mr. Alsop, thinking gloomy
thoughts about the waste of himself which a
talented man commits when he takes up the life
of a teacher, swung sharply round the corner of
his dormitory, he beheld a most exasperating
sight.</p>

<p>Wally Sedgwick had been loafing in 7 Hale
that morning, keeping both Sam and Duncan
from work which neither wanted to do. Wally’s
hat lay on the window seat. Duncan, concluding
that Wally had overstopped his leave, lifted the
window and pushed the hat gently from its
resting-place. Then he calmly informed Wally
that his “dip” had fallen out. Both peered
over the sill to see where the hat had fallen.</p>

<p>John Fish, in the room below, had caught sight
of the object falling past his window, and leaned
out to investigate. It occurred to him immediately
that (as the physicians say) water was
indicated; so he brought his pitcher and began
pouring upon the hat. Duncan, observing this
manœuvre from above, was seized with a bright
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
idea. He too fetched a pitcher and poured his
libation upon John Fish’s unprotected head as it
projected from the window below. It was this
spectacle of pitchers and streams of water and
heads and an all-suffering hat which greeted Mr.
Alsop’s gaze and outraged his sense of propriety
as he emerged into view before the front of Hale.</p>

<p>Fish did not pour long. The chilling grip of
the water upon the back of his neck quickly reminded
him that his conduct was unbecoming.
Duncan stopped when Fish stopped, but neither
before the teacher got a good view of the offenders.</p>

<p>“Gee, there’s Alsop!” cried Duncan, jumping
back into the obscurity of the room. “My
name is mud.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll go,” said Wally, quickly, “before
some one pinches the hat.”</p>

<p>Wally scuttled downstairs, dashed past the
teacher at the door, seized his hat and sped away
from danger. Mr. Alsop mounted directly to
Number 7, and knocked vigorously. Sam opened
the door.</p>

<p>“Peck, it was you who were pouring water out
of your window upon the head of a boy below?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i183" src="images/i183.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">This Spectacle of Pitchers and streams of water and
heads greeted Mr. Alsop’s gaze.</span>&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_164">Page 164</a>.</i></p></div>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Duncan, promptly, “but it
was in self-defence. You see, the hat fell out,
and before we could get it, some one downstairs
began to dump water on it. I had to do the
same thing to him to make him stop.”</p>

<p>“I suppose there was no other way of stopping
him,” answered Mr. Alsop, with angry sarcasm.
“You knew very well that all throwing of water
from dormitory windows is forbidden. I shall
report you at the office as on study hours.”</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty note!” said Duncan in disgust
as soon as the enemy was out of hearing. “Put
me on study hours for that! It was nothing at
all. Fellows do it all the time in Sibley and
Wentworth and don’t get even a call-down. That’s
a way to run a dormitory, isn’t it? He probably
won’t do anything to Black Hand Fish!”</p>

<p>Therein Duncan was wrong. Mr. Alsop stopped
on his way downstairs to give Fish the same
punishment, but he did it with reluctance, in fact
almost apologetically, and he took the penalty
off at the end of a week. Duncan, being of a
proud spirit and showing evident resentment
in his manner, the instructor disciplined by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
longer period of restraint. During this season of
penance, when Duncan was at home morning,
afternoon, and evening, cut off from all visitors,
the two room-mates were inevitably much together.
Some of this time Duncan wasted in maledictions
on his unjust fate and on all those whom he held
responsible for his sufferings; some he spent
profitably in studying, and in getting acquainted
with his room-mate. The experience of this
period, which proved effectively the value of Sam’s
friendship, destroyed the last shreds of the prejudice
which Duncan had nursed so long. He
signalized his conversion by suggesting to Archer
that it was time they addressed each other by
their first names. He made atonement, not by
falling on his friend’s neck and beseeching his
pardon for misjudging him, but by treating him
with frank cordiality at home and commending
him abroad.</p>

<p>“Black Hand” Fish, released from the ban at
the end of a week with a gentle recommendation
that he restrain his sprightliness, returned most
subservient thanks and went his old way. Fish’s
old way was not a good one from the point of view
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
of morality or of the happiness of his neighbors.
He was the “bad boy” of the well, a natural
Ishmaelite. His hand was against every one.
He borrowed money without the slightest intention
of paying; he rough-housed recklessly in the
rooms of those not strong enough to eject him,
smashed furniture, threw books, spilled ink, played
hair-dresser with the shoe-brush. And withal, so
strong was the code of honor among his victims,
so suave and respectful was his demeanor toward
Mr. Alsop, so craftily did he choose his hours of
molestation, that the teacher had no suspicion of
his character. When Mr. Alsop passed Fish’s
room on a visit of reproof to Fowle, and saw on
the door a threatening demand for money emphasized
by the drawing of a black hand, he reflected
sadly upon the persecution which an orderly student
must suffer at the hands of the disorderly.
Indeed, he felt tempted to call a meeting of the
well to protest against the cowardice of anonymous
threats.</p>

<p>Fish himself was not greatly disturbed by the
sight of these manifestoes. He was not to be
frightened into disgorging by the threat of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Black Hand. When, however, a similar notice
appeared on the blotting-paper on his desk, he began
to suspect his long-suffering room-mate Moorhead,
and made him the special object of his attentions.
Moorhead was a studious youth, an honor
man, very ambitious to keep his rank. Fish hid
his books, poured away the water from his pitcher,
pulled his bed to pieces, inked his exercises. A
favorite diversion was to sing Moorhead to the
verge of madness when the boy wanted to study.
This was especially effective when a “dec” had
to be learned, or lines memorized for English.</p>

<p>With the occupants of Number 7 Fish took no
liberties. They “wouldn’t stand for it,” and they
were capable of defending themselves. The weaker
inhabitants of the well safeguarded themselves
and their possessions as best they could by keeping
their doors locked. Even with this precaution
there were times when the pest found admittance.
Being debarred from outside disturbance
by the serious threats of the trio, he was in a way
thrown back upon the rooms for amusement.</p>

<p>Spring came, if a muddy windy March has any
right to the name of spring. Sam, whose reputation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
was better with other teachers than with
Mr. Alsop, sometimes got permission to go off
with his gun. He returned one Wednesday
night, empty-handed, as usual, but eloquent of the
grandeur of the heavy surf as it broke over the
rocks at the foot of Great Boar’s Head. He
wrote a theme on the subject before he went to
bed, and read it to Duncan.</p>

<p>“Gee! but it must be worth seeing!” exclaimed
Duncan. “If that beast of an Alsop hadn’t put
me on study hours, I might go down and get a
look at it.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask him to take you off?”</p>

<p>“Ask him to take me off!” repeated Duncan,
indignantly. “I wouldn’t ask him to take me out
of a pit, if I were dying of thirst!”</p>

<p>“He probably wouldn’t do it anyway,” remarked
Sam, recalling the humiliating refusal
which he had himself received when he asked for a
special make-up on French vocabulary.</p>

<p>Thursday and Friday the wind blew hard from
the east. Saturday was clear. At nine, after his
first recitation, Duncan came dashing in with the
signals of exciting news flaming in eye and cheek.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

<p>“Alsop’s gone to Boston to-day to tell the
Modern Language Profs how to do it. He won’t
get back until to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“What of it?” asked Sam, calmly.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take a holiday. I’m going to see
the surf, that’s ‘what of it’!”</p>

<p>“You’d better not. You can’t get permission;
and if any of them see you, they’ll report you, and
it’ll be all up with you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to stay cooped up here all the
time. I did nothing to be put on probation for,
not as much as John Fish, and he was let off a
week ago. I’m going to see the surf!”</p>

<p>“Supposing they see you?”</p>

<p>“They won’t see me. I’ll get something to eat
early down at McLane’s; then I’ll take the one
o’clock car outside the town. Nobody would
leave as early as that, and if they do, Brucie, who’s
got permission to go, will take the same car in town,
and signal me at the right place if there’s any danger.
Then I’ll jump off at Leavitt’s, skip over to the
rocks, have a look at the waves, and take the
same car back. I’ll be here by three.”</p>

<p>“It’s risky,” said Sam, thoughtfully.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>“I’ll take the risk!”</p>

<p>All that morning, Duncan’s foolhardy scheme
troubled Sam’s mind. There was danger in it&mdash;a
danger quite out of proportion to the pleasure
to be gained. The boy who leaves town without
permission goes permanently. That was a rule
to which the faculty rarely made exceptions. It
was useless to expostulate with Duncan; he had
made up his mind, and the resolution of a boy
who had studied the ins and outs of Academy
discipline for four years could hardly be expected
to yield to the objections of a newcomer. And
yet there was an objection which appeared to Sam
to be serious.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do about the two
o’clock car going down?” he asked Duncan, as the
chums came together again at twelve o’clock.
“There’s sure to be some one on that who would
recognize you; it will pass you at the power-house.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy!” answered Duncan, confidently.
“I’ll duck down when we pass the cars, going and
coming. If you’re trying to scare me out of this,
you’re wasting your breath. I’m going, anyway.”</p>

<p>This ended Sam’s attempts at interference.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
He hung around the room for a while after Duncan
had gone, then hunted up Dr. Leighton and
asked permission to go to the salt marshes or
elsewhere, shooting. Dr. Leighton knew Mr.
Archer and believed in the boy. As a result, we
may say by way of parenthesis, the boy believed
in Dr. Leighton, and, what is more to the point,
strove to earn his esteem by honest work for him.
Dr. Leighton’s permission was quickly obtained.</p>

<p>Sam boarded the two o’clock car in his shooting
togs, without any clear idea as to his purpose.
He didn’t care much about shooting that afternoon,
and he did want to help Duncan, but how
he could help Duncan he had but the vaguest
notion. If there were teachers aboard, he might
engage them in talk at the critical time, and so
divert their attention. Two teachers did get in at
the square, Professor Towle and Mr. Snow, both
elderly men above the temptation of spying&mdash;the
fault of overzealous youth&mdash;but quite as
rigid in their sense of duty as their younger colleagues.
If Duncan showed himself, his head was
forfeit.</p>

<p>The car bowled rapidly along the desolate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
water-soaked highway. Sam left his seat and
went forward with the motorman to catch the
first glimpse of the waiting car at the turnout.
As they bore down upon the power-house, they
saw ahead of them a group of workmen gathered
about a heavily loaded service car which appeared
to have broken down, obstructing both main
track and turnout.</p>

<p>“Looks like a block,” observed the motorman,
as he crowded down the brake.</p>

<p>“What will they do?” asked Sam, quickly.</p>

<p>“Probably swap passengers with the up car
when it comes, and send us back.”</p>

<p>The car came to a stop. The motorman opened
the door of his vestibule and leaned out. Sam
peered over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to go back, Jim,” said an official
to the conductor. “Transfer your passengers.”</p>

<p>Sam seized his gun, pushed by the motorman,
and strolled along the track past the obstruction.
As soon as he felt himself sheltered by the derailed
car from the argus eye of the faculty, he jumped
the wall, and in its shelter ran headlong for the
curve round which the up car was expected.

<span class="medium">MR. ALSOP BARKS</span></h2>

<p>Two minutes later a youth in khaki, armed with
a gun, stopped the up car just around the curve
beyond the power-house, called out a startled
passenger, and let the car go on. Those who
were curious enough to look back&mdash;including a
shrewdly grinning conductor&mdash;saw the pair disappear
over the fence into a clump of trees.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” demanded Duncan, as soon as
his foot touched the ground.</p>

<p>“They’re going to transfer passengers at the
power-house. Towle and Snow are there&mdash;”
Sam stopped for breath; his run up the hill had
winded him. “You’d have been caught like a
rat in a trap.”</p>

<p>Duncan whistled, and gave vent to a variety
of exclamations prompted by a variety of feelings.
Sam cut into them abruptly.</p>

<p>“You can’t show yourself until after the car
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
passes here. By that time the other one will have
gone, and there isn’t another for an hour.”</p>

<p>“And some one is likely to be on that,” said
Duncan, gravely.</p>

<p>“Yes, and on the one after. If you want me
to, I’ll stay down and watch to see who’s aboard,
and give you a signal. Or&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Or what?”</p>

<p>“You might walk back. It’s only five miles.”</p>

<p>“In all this mud?” cried Duncan.</p>

<p>“It isn’t so bad on the track; and it’s the safest
way. If any one sees you walking, it won’t hurt,
because you’ve got a right to walk where you
want to.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said Duncan. “Well, I guess
I’ll walk. What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I got permission for the marshes. I suppose
I ought to go.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead!” answered Duncan. “There comes
your car. I’ll see you when you get home.”</p>

<p>Sam vaulted the fence, stopped his car, and got
in. Professor Towle fastened on him a questioning
glance as he sat down.</p>

<p>“We were wondering what had become of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
you,” said the teacher, kindly. “You went on
ahead?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Sam, demurely.</p>

<p>“Rather unpleasant walking,” remarked Mr.
Snow, looking at Sam’s muddy feet.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind the walking,” Sam hastened to
say. “When you’re out with a gun, you go through
so much mud that a little more or less doesn’t
count.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” responded Mr. Snow. Professor
Towle was thinking in a half-interested way that
it was a queer freak for a boy to go ahead of
a car on a day like this, and wondering vaguely
what prompted the impulse. He did not wonder
long. When one has been guessing more or less
unsuccessfully at schoolboy conundrums for a
quarter of a century, one gives up easily before a
casual new one.</p>

<p>When Sam came back to 7 Hale that night,
with game bag empty as usual, he found
Duncan stretched out in an easy chair before the
fire, arrayed in bath robe and slippers. His shoes,
brown with mud and bleached at the tips with
water, sulked, neglected, in a corner.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>“Been to dinner?” inquired Sam, as he opened
the door.</p>

<p>“Not going,” Duncan answered laconically.
“When I got back about five, I was so dead hungry
I couldn’t wait for dinner, so I filled up at McLane’s.
You see I didn’t stop for much luncheon
this noon. I had a whopping big steak with
two orders of French fried, and half a lemon pie.
I sha’n’t want anything more to eat this week.”</p>

<p>“What do you think about it now; was it worth
while or not?” Sam talked from his bedroom,
where he was busy peeling off his soaked clothes.</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t,” responded Duncan, slowly.
“I didn’t see much of the surf, and I came near
getting into trouble.” He waited a minute and
added as an afterthought, “From one point of
view it was.”</p>

<p>“What’s that&mdash;exercise?”</p>

<p>“No. I found out what a good fellow I’ve
got for a room-mate!”</p>

<p>A thrill of delight ran through Sam’s chilly
limbs as he heard this unexpected acknowledgment.
His own heart had long since declared
itself. Yet an instinct of self-repression, inbred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
by many generations of Puritan ancestors, combined
with the aversion to sentiment common to
all boys, forced an almost flippant answer to his
lips. “You’d better wait till the end of the year
before you say that. Your opinion of me may
slump.”</p>

<p>“I’ve waited long enough&mdash;too long. You
got me sour on you at first when you turned me
out of my room; then the way you let Mulcahy
work you, made me sore.”</p>

<p>“I was pretty slow about Mulcahy,” confessed
Sam, “but that was partly your fault.
I thought you were unfair to him, and that made
me hang on to him.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to go down there this
afternoon?” asked Duncan, with an abrupt
change. “You didn’t say anything about going
when I started off.”</p>

<p>“I thought I might as well go,” Sam answered
carelessly. He shied at confessing the real reason.</p>

<p>“You saved my neck, all right,” remarked
Duncan. “I believe you went on purpose. I’m
going to think so, anyway.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>Sam hurried his shower and his dressing and
got over to dinner before the doors were closed.
On his way back he stopped at Dr. Leighton’s
rooms to tell him that he had returned within
the time set. Dr. Leighton invited him in, and
they talked together intimately for an hour, not as
teacher and pupil, but as friends. They fell ultimately
upon the subject of injustice in the school
life; of boys who trotted and cribbed and got C,
while boys who plugged and were honest got E;
of lies that secured immunity when the truth
brought punishment; of Duncan Peck kept on
pro for three weeks when Fish got off with one for
the same offence; of the troubles of mischievous
Birdie Fowle, who, though by no means a bad
boy, was considered a monster, while others
were thoroughly corrupt and yet enjoyed an
immaculate reputation; of hypocrites who joined
the Christian Frat because it would help them
with the faculty, yet showed no respect for the
principles of the organization. Dr. Leighton did
not deny the facts of injustice; he did not undertake
to absolve either himself or his colleagues
from all mistakes in their estimates of the boys.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
But he did try to show that injustice is not intentional
or permanent, that immorality and dishonesty
are sure to work their way to the light
of day and receive their reward; that no boy
can escape the responsibility for his own character
and influence. Sam went home feeling
that his own unimportant life, if lived cleanly and
honorably, might have a value in the school
world.</p>

<p>Mr. Alsop returned Monday morning, his sensitive
and suspicious soul agitated by a dire discovery.
He had distinctly seen, as he walked
along a Boston street on Saturday evening,
Duncan Peck with another, unrecognized boy
entering a theatre&mdash;Duncan Peck, whom he
himself had put on probation, and who could
not, save by misrepresentation, get leave of absence
from any one. He went immediately to
Peck’s boarding place&mdash;Duncan had long since
wearied of Alumni&mdash;to make inquiries, and
learned that Peck had not been present at dinner
Saturday night nor at breakfast Sunday morning.
He visited the matron of the dormitory, and was
told that the maid who had gone in to take care
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
of Number 7 on Sunday had reported Peck sleeping
soundly at nine o’clock, with shoes standing
before the fireplace still wet, and muddy trousers
hanging over a chair. Remembering the heavy
downpour of rain which had occurred early that
morning, Mr. Alsop felt that his case was complete.
The rascal had broken his probation, had
taken a six o’clock train to Boston Saturday
night, attended the theatre in the evening, spent
the rest of the night&mdash;no one knew how&mdash;and
returned in fancied security by the paper train
very early in the morning. It was a piece of
tragic but most successful detective work. The
circumstantial evidence supporting the testimony
of his own eyes was complete.</p>

<p>Yet before he laid the scandal in all its appalling
details before the faculty, Mr. Alsop decided to
question Peck, and incidentally Archer. It should
never be said that he had condemned a boy
without a hearing. From Archer he expected
no confirmation of his own true account of Peck’s
movements on that fatal night, for in accordance
with the notions of loyalty prevailing among the
students, a room-mate would feel bound to hide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
the facts, however heinous the guilt of the offender.
Peck, of course, would not hesitate to
lie, when he found himself trapped.</p>

<p>The two boys rose as the instructor walked
solemnly into the room. He dismissed the
offered chair with a wave of the hand and a chilly
“Thank you,” and entered straightway upon his
business.</p>

<p>“Peck, I have come to ask you about your
absence from town on Saturday,” he began.</p>

<p>Duncan threw a look of dismay at his chum.
“My absence from town!” he exclaimed, striving
to appear wholly surprised, yet conscious of a
traitorous blush suffusing his cheeks and a well-nigh
irresistible inclination to avoid the instructor’s
stern eye.</p>

<p>“Yes, from town,” repeated Mr. Alsop, with
slow and distinct emphasis.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean, sir,” said Duncan.</p>

<p>It would have been an interesting problem for
a medi&aelig;val casuist to determine the moral character
of this statement; whether a black lie, a white
lie, or no lie at all. Duncan used it merely as a
means of drawing the teacher out. He suspected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
that he knew only too well what the instructor
meant. Yet, as a fact, he knew nothing. Mr.
Alsop recognized it at once as the first of the
expected chain of falsehoods, and sharpened his
wits to detect its successor.</p>

<p>“Where were you on Saturday afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Knocking around,” answered Peck, vaguely,
sure now that he saw Mr. Alsop’s meaning, and
wondering how he had been found out.</p>

<p>“Were you out of town?”</p>

<p>Duncan was silent.</p>

<p>“Where were you in the evening?” went on
the inquisitor, triumphantly. The weak line of
defence was already breaking.</p>

<p>“Here,” replied the defendant, puzzled to
understand the bearing of the question.</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure, Peck?” said the questioner,
solemnly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Sam stepped forward and opened his lips,
“Mr. Alsop&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by an uplifted hand. “I
am questioning Peck, if you please.” Sam
retired, abashed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p>“Were you not in Boston Saturday evening,
Peck?”</p>

<p>“In Boston!” Into this three-syllabled explosion
Duncan compressed a heavy charge of
wonder and relief.</p>

<p>“Yes, in Boston!” returned Mr. Alsop, with
sharp emphasis. “You are doubtless an excellent
actor, Peck, but please do not answer my questions
with exclamations. Were you in Boston Saturday
night or not?”</p>

<p>“Not!” replied Duncan, his eyes twinkling,
and the corners of his mouth twitching in an
incipient smile. He had recovered his self-possession
completely.</p>

<p>“This is not a fit subject for jest, Peck.”
Duncan’s face sobered immediately. “It is a
very serious matter. I repeat my question once
more and demand a frank answer. Were you in
Boston last Saturday evening?”</p>

<p>“I was not,” answered Duncan, in a low voice,
with his eyes fixed on the floor.</p>

<p>“It would be better to confess honestly than
to persist in a lie, Peck,” continued Mr. Alsop,
in a judicial manner.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p>Duncan did not reply. His head was turned
away.</p>

<p>“The fact is bound to come out, whether you
admit it or not.”</p>

<p>“What fact?”</p>

<p>“The fact that you were in Boston Saturday
night. I saw you there with my own eyes just
as you were entering the Colonial Theatre!”</p>

<p>Duncan drew a long breath, and waited an
artistic interval before replying. “I suppose
if you saw me&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>“If I saw you, what, Peck?” prompted the
teacher, gently.</p>

<p>“If I should confess, should I get off any
easier?”</p>

<p>“I can make no promises. The faculty would
doubtless give the fact consideration. You have
been a long time in school.”</p>

<p>“Why, he has nothing to confess!” broke in
Sam. “He was here Saturday evening. I can
testify to it.”</p>

<p>To Sam’s surprise, Duncan turned roughly
upon him. “It’s no use for you to say that.
You’d better keep your fingers out of it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

<p>Mr. Alsop nodded approval. “I respect your
desire to help your friend, Archer, but false
testimony will only serve to hurt you without
benefiting Peck.”</p>

<p>This calm assumption that he was prepared to
act the part of a false witness wounded Sam’s
self-respect and stirred his indignation. For the
instant, however, he was dumb with astonishment.
Before he could gather his wits to make
protest, Duncan had turned away from Mr. Alsop
and shot at his chum a beseeching look, emphasized
by a vigorous side jerk of the head, that
closed the boy’s opening lips.</p>

<p>Again silence, broken by Mr. Alsop.</p>

<p>“It is better to make a clean breast of it, Peck,”
he said, in a persuasive voice.</p>

<p>Peck drew another long breath and lifted his
eyes to the instructor’s face. He had evidently
taken a deep resolution.</p>

<p>“Tell me everything frankly,” encouraged
Mr. Alsop.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t in Boston at all,” declared Duncan,
lapsing suddenly into a sullen manner. “I
haven’t been in Boston for five weeks.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>

<p>Mr. Alsop’s face hardened. “You insist on
that story, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse for you, then. The faculty
will consider the case on Tuesday evening. I
will give you until that time to come to your
senses.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="medium">UP THE WRONG TREE</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Alsop closed the door of Number 7 behind
him, more than ever convinced that he had
caught an experienced and clever offender.
Peck’s confusion when suddenly taxed with an
absence from town which he had supposed totally
unknown, his theatrical attempt to bluff, his
apparent conflict in mind over the wisdom of
confessing and throwing himself on Mr. Alsop’s
mercy, his pains to keep an over-loyal room-mate
from committing himself to a falsehood, his
final decision to abide by the original denial&mdash;all
this was the natural behavior of a conscious
culprit. The unfortunate boy had been given
an opportunity to confess and gain a possible
mitigation of penalty. The instructor’s conscience
was clear.</p>

<p>Inside Number 7 Duncan was dancing in
transports of merriment. “Did you ever hear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
anything like it!” he cried. “Oh, but it’s great!
If some fool doesn’t butt in and spoil it all before
to-morrow night!”</p>

<p>“You’re a fool yourself!” said Sam, in disgust.
“Why didn’t you let me tell him the facts? I
could have cleared you.”</p>

<p>“Because I didn’t want to be cleared,” declared
Duncan, joyfully; “because this is the chance of
a lifetime to get back at him for all his spying
at keyholes and sneaking round. If you’d blurted
out everything you wanted to say, you might
have made him doubt, and I don’t want him to
doubt.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to be fired for what you didn’t
do?” demanded Sam. “You weren’t in Boston.
You were here.”</p>

<p>“I know I was here, but he doesn’t. He’ll
bring it up before the faculty&mdash;and then!&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And then what?”</p>

<p>“He’ll get a fall, a nice, hard, dizzy fall that’ll
make him see stars. He’ll rise a better man.”</p>

<p>Sam stared for some seconds and meditated.
“I don’t see why you’re so sure about that,”
he said at length. “I’m the only one who can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
prove you were here. If he doesn’t believe me,
why should the rest?”</p>

<p>“You’re not the only one!”</p>

<p>“Were you out that night? If you were, you
broke your probation.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t out.”</p>

<p>“If you had fellows in here, you broke your
probation just the same.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t have fellows in here. The laundryman
brought my bundle and collected a dollar
twenty. Better than the laundryman, Mr. Sedgwick
came to invite you there Sunday night&mdash;I
forgot to tell you about it.”</p>

<p>Sam’s face showed deep disgust. “You’re a
fine man to leave a message with, aren’t you?
Here it is Monday morning. They’ll think I’m
a chump!”</p>

<p>“Never you mind! She’ll forgive you. You
can go this afternoon and tell them how it happened.
Maybe you’ll get another invitation.
Anyway, Mr. Sedgwick makes a second witness.
Alsop might suppose I’d fixed the laundryman,
but they’ll have to believe Mr. Sedgwick. Then
there’s Don.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>“What has Don to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Sammy, you’re positively thick. Who do
you suppose Alsop really saw in Boston?”</p>

<p>“How should I know?”</p>

<p>“He saw Don!”</p>

<p>Then a light suddenly broke upon Sam’s
slow mind. He had met Donald Peck, Duncan’s
twin, on the morning of the Hillbury football
game, and had been amazed at the close resemblance
between the two brothers. Since then,
various anecdotes of the pair, current in the
school, had come to his ears, and Duncan himself
had told him much about their experiences
together.</p>

<p>“That’s just what happened!” Sam cried.
“Don came in from Cambridge to go to the
theatre, and Alsop saw him. I wonder why he
didn’t think of Don.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t think of anything except that
he’d caught me,” said Duncan. “He wasn’t
looking for ways of proving me innocent.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Oh, yes, I am! I’m going to
telephone Don, and if he says he went to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
Colonial Theatre that night, I’ll get him to write
me a letter.”</p>

<p>The routine business of the faculty meeting on
Tuesday had been disposed of. Petitions from
various misguided students for an extension of
the approaching spring vacation had been refused.
It had been decided that the Mandolin Club might
not give a concert in Haverhill, and that the
Assembly Club under certain conditions might
hold a dance on the evening of a certain Friday.
The secretary was reading the alphabetical list
of students to refresh the memories of those
members of the faculty who had come to the
meeting with questions to ask or charges to bring.
Halfway through the catalogue of seniors, at the
name of Peck, Mr. Alsop interposed.</p>

<p>“Stop there, please! Did any one give Peck
permission to go to Boston on Saturday night?”</p>

<p>Silence effectually answered the question. “I
thought not,” continued Mr. Alsop. “He is on
special probation. I was in Boston over Sunday,
and on Saturday night, a little after eight, I saw
Peck just entering a theatre on Boylston Street
with a companion whom I did not know. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
soon as I returned I made inquiries at his boarding
place, and learned that he was absent from
dinner on Saturday night and from breakfast
Sunday morning. The chambermaid reported
him in bed at nine o’clock on Sunday, his shoes
standing before the fireplace still wet. There was
a heavy rain early Sunday morning, as you
perhaps remember. I am convinced that he
left town by the six o’clock train Saturday and
returned by the paper train Sunday morning.
I questioned him about the matter and told him
where I had seen him. He was confused in his
answers, and at one time seemed on the point
of confessing, but he finally decided to take the
other course, and faced it out to the end.” Mr.
Alsop paused.</p>

<p>“If you saw him,” said Mr. Moore, who was
presiding, “I should say that it is a case for
immediate dismissal.”</p>

<p>“I saw him distinctly.”</p>

<p>“Who is his room-mate?” asked Professor
Towle.</p>

<p>“Archer.”</p>

<p>“What does Archer say?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p>“Archer would probably pretend that Peck
was in his room on Saturday evening. He was
about to say something to this effect, but Peck,
who evidently wanted to keep him from committing
himself to a false statement, objected
to his testifying.”</p>

<p>“That seems a strange proceeding,” remarked
Professor Towle. “A boy who would run away
from school for a night wouldn’t be likely to care
whether his room-mate lied or not as long as the
testimony was in his favor.”</p>

<p>“I should myself be very unwilling to believe
either that Peck would leave town without permission
or that Archer would lie about it afterward,”
said Dr. Leighton, for the first time taking
part in the discussion.</p>

<p>“It is a question of fact, not of opinion,”
replied Mr. Alsop, tartly. “It might not seem to
you so unlikely, if you had seen as much of the
pair as I have.”</p>

<p>“Might it not have been Donald Peck whom
you saw?” asked Dr. Leighton. “He is in
Cambridge, and might very well have been in
Boston that night.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>The effect of this question was first to stagger
and then to anger Mr. Alsop. In his zeal to
bring the guilty Duncan to punishment, he had
put aside all thought of error in identification.
This reminder of the existence of Duncan’s
double came to him as a shock. He entertained
the suggestion but a moment, however, dismissing
it immediately as reflecting on the accuracy
of his observation.</p>

<p>“I can only repeat,” he said with frigid dignity,
“that I saw Duncan Peck in Boston Saturday
night. The suggestion that the evidence of my
own eyes is not trustworthy will not explain
his two absences from meals, nor the condition
of his room on Sunday morning, nor his very
noticeable confusion on being questioned.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid we are spending time unprofitably,”
broke in Mr. Moore. “May I suggest
that the case be left to a committee, with full
power to dismiss the boy if he is found guilty?”</p>

<p>Professor Towle moved that Dr. Leighton,
Mr. Alsop, and Mr. Snow constitute such a committee.
The motion was passed and the august
body continued its review of the list, putting six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
boys on special probation for an excess of five
chapel cuts during the term, voting that notice
be sent to three fathers that their sons must be
withdrawn, ordering A. Jones to retire from the
Assembly Club, and B. Brown to give up either
French or German, and C. Smith to pay before
Thursday for the damage done in his room or
be suspended,&mdash;and so on for a ruthless hour of
house-cleaning.</p>

<p>After his first recitation next morning, Dr.
Leighton got to work on the task of his committee.
He found Duncan and Sam together in
7 Hale. Sam retired at the suggestion of the
teacher that he wished to talk with Peck alone.</p>

<p>“Was I fired?” asked Duncan, when Dr. Leighton
had stated his errand. Duncan’s manner
showed plenty of curiosity, but little deep concern.</p>

<p>“Your fate is in the hands of a committee,”
replied Dr. Leighton. “If it is true that you
were in Boston that night, I couldn’t keep you
here if I would, and you may be sure that I
should not try to do so. The question is one of
fact. At present the presumption is against you.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
I want first your own word. Were you in Boston
Saturday night?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” responded Duncan, promptly, looking
frankly into the teacher’s serious face. The
boy’s expression was serious too, except as to the
eyes. In them gleamed but half suppressed a
glint of fun.</p>

<p>“Where were you?”</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>

<p>“Did any one see you here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Sam Archer.”</p>

<p>“His evidence might satisfy me, but not others.
It is conceivable that a room-mate should feel in
duty bound to defend his friend at the expense
of a lie. Did no one else see you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“The man who delivers for Jetteau’s laundry,
a short, red-faced fellow. We call him Pete.”</p>

<p>Dr. Leighton wrote in his book: “Pete, Jetteau’s
laundry.” “I wish it had been a better witness,”
he said regretfully.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>“There was a better witness,” said Duncan,
his satisfaction now breaking forth into a broad
grin, “Mr. Sedgwick.”</p>

<p>Dr. Leighton closed his notebook with a snap.
“Did he see you here?” he demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He came a little before eight to
invite Sam to supper the next day.” Duncan’s
face took on a rueful look as he added, “I forgot
to tell Sam until this morning.”</p>

<p>“You ought to have given me his name in the
beginning.” Dr. Leighton spoke reprovingly, but
with evident relief.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sedgwick came last,” answered Duncan,
demurely. “I was giving the witnesses in exact
order.”</p>

<p>Dr. Leighton laughed, a frank, natural, unprof-like
laugh. “You always were a joker,
Duncan, but take care how you joke with the
faculty. Some of us don’t understand jokes.”</p>

<p>Duncan grinned in silent comprehension.</p>

<p>“But why didn’t you tell this to Mr. Alsop?”
pursued Dr. Leighton, now serious again. “It
Would have saved all this misunderstanding.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t give me any chance,” said Duncan.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
“He spent all his time trying to make me confess
I’d done what I hadn’t done.”</p>

<p>“But you prevented Sam from testifying.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” declared Duncan, stoutly. “As
Alsop was so sure I was bad, I thought he might
as well find out the truth himself. I hoped
it would come hard, for he’s treated me dirty
mean.”</p>

<p>“How has he treated you meanly?” asked
Dr. Leighton, quietly.</p>

<p>“Lots of ways. For one thing, he’s kept me
on probation three weeks for throwing water
out the window, when the fellow who started the
thing only got one.”</p>

<p>“Go and get Archer,” commanded Dr. Leighton.</p>

<p>“Was Peck here Saturday night?” asked the
instructor, as the two boys returned.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Sam, eagerly. “He was
here the whole evening from the time I came in
a little after eight. We both went to bed about
eleven. He was no more in Boston than I was.”</p>

<p>“One thing more, Peck,” said the teacher,
turning abruptly on Duncan. “Where were
you on Saturday afternoon?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p>Duncan’s countenance fell. “Knocking around,”
he answered cautiously.</p>

<p>“That’s indefinite. You were not at dinner.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I got my dinner at McLane’s at
about five.”</p>

<p>“And before five?”</p>

<p>Peck hesitated, looked at his room-mate, then
out the window, then at his room-mate again,
and at last into Dr. Leighton’s face.</p>

<p>“I’d rather not tell you; that is, officially.
I’ll tell you personally, if you like. I didn’t do
anything bad.”</p>

<p>“Personally then, if it must be,” said the instructor.</p>

<p>“I went to Hampton Beach to see the surf.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“I went down on the one o’clock car and came
back on it. I walked up from the power-house.”</p>

<p>Dr. Leighton was silent, while Duncan shifted
nervously from foot to foot, and wondered wildly
whether he had made the great mistake of being
confidential with an untrustworthy prof. Dr.
Leighton, however, understood clearly the distinction
intended; he had agreed to receive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Duncan’s confession, not as a member of the
faculty, but as a friend of the confessor. Officially
he could take no cognizance of the affair.
He must speak as a friend and adviser, or not
at all.</p>

<p>“Duncan,” he said with slow seriousness, “in
going to Hampton you were leaving town without
permission just as much as if you had gone to
Boston, as Mr. Alsop thought you did. That
Mr. Alsop treated you unfairly, or that your visit
was for an innocent purpose, is no excuse whatever
for the act. You broke a rule on which the
school wisely insists, and the punishment for
which you well knew. In that you were totally
wrong.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Duncan, humbly.</p>

<p>“You understand that if your absence is discovered
and the fact brought before the faculty,
I cannot say a word in your defence?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Now I want you to promise, and promise
honestly, that for the rest of the year you will
try to keep well within the school rules.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p>“Good!” Dr. Leighton held out his hand, and
turned to go. At the door he spoke again.
“One more word of advice&mdash;as a friend. You
have the advantage over Mr. Alsop in this Boston
affair. Use it to come to a better understanding
with him, and not to annoy him. Remember
that there is a very weak spot in your own armor.”</p>

<p>When the teacher was gone, the two boys remained
for a time in silence. Duncan’s malicious
joy in the prospect of Mr. Alsop’s humiliation had
given place to a serious mood. “Leighton’s a
square man!” he said at length. “You’d do
right for a man like him when you’d rather do
wrong; while as for Alsop, why, you’d do wrong
for him when you’d rather do right, just to spite
him.” And therein Duncan Peck showed a
knowledge of the essential traits of an inspiring
teacher which is rarely possessed by school
trustees.</p>

<p>Later in the day Mr. Alsop came to apologize
for his error, and the interview left a pleasant
impression with both participants. Duncan had
special reason to be satisfied with it, as the instructor,
to make amends for his false accusation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
removed the annoying probation. Through Dr.
Leighton’s influence the special committee made
no report to the faculty, and Mr. Alsop was
spared the pain of an official verdict on his
blunder.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="medium">THE SOCIALIST</span></h2>

<p>For a few days after Duncan’s acquittal,
Mr. Alsop seemed really to have profited by his
lesson. It is no slight humiliation to make a
theatrical charge of falsehood against two boys,
and then be compelled to eat one’s words in sackcloth
and ashes. The tale circulated among the
students in a variety of versions, none of which
was inferior to the truth in picturesqueness.
Members of the faculty smiled significantly as
they passed on the word that the committee on
Peck would not report, even while they deplored
their colleague’s misfortune and expatiated on his
devotion to duty. The discomfited instructor had
to draw on his whole fund of self-esteem to save
himself from confessing that some of his methods
needed mending. As he treated Sam with
unwonted consideration in recitation for the next
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
few days, and Sam, as a result, made more conscientious
preparation of lessons, it began to look
as if Sam, at least, was to be the gainer.</p>

<p>Birdie Fowle was left alone to bear the weight
of Mr. Alsop’s particular suspicion, and Birdie
dropped as naturally into trouble, as a fly into
the milk-pail. Taylor and Sam, with Birdie, had
one evening been enjoying a most exhilarating
game of ball in Birdie’s room. They used a
baseball and a bat. Sofa cushions piled in the
corner constituted the field. To hit the Harvard
cushion was a base hit, the Yale cushion counted
for two bases, the pillow with the girl’s head on it
three, and the S cushion a home run. To miss the
cushions altogether was an out. The sport was
great; the cries of the trio floated out through the
open windows, and the floor trembled with the
lunges of the players. Mr. Alsop, who had
latterly resolved not to interfere with the boys
in their rooms unless the disturbance was serious,
growing impatient under the strain, tramped his
study, nervously asking himself, with each crescendo
from above, whether the time had not now
come when he really must interfere. Then the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
noises ceased, and he went back to his work
relieved.</p>

<p>The game was at its height when a knock at
the door sent the guests scurrying to the closets.
Poor Birdie, bound to obey the summons, tossed
the cushions back upon the sofa, ran his fingers
through his disordered hair, threw on his coat,
and hurried to open the door. Without stood
Brantwein with his basket of “hot dogs.”</p>

<p>“You old fraud!” exclaimed Birdie. “I
thought sure it was Alsop.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be so glad it isn’t that you’d
want to buy me out,” observed Brantwein, as he
pushed in. “I’ll sell you the whole stock for an
even dollar.”</p>

<p>“Come out!” yelled Fowle. “It’s only
Brandy!” The hidden players emerged. “Who
wants a dog?”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a dime for three,” offered Taylor.
“That’s all they’re worth.”</p>

<p>“They’re the best I ever sold, specially fine
breed of dog,” returned Brantwein, seriously.
“They’re really worth ten apiece, but I’ll let
you have ’em for a nickel.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<p>“Hot?” asked Sam, thrusting his hand into
the basket.</p>

<p>“Two hundred twelve degrees,” answered the
vendor, as he pulled his basket well out of Sam’s
reach. “Don’t handle the pups.”</p>

<p>Fowle treated the crowd, and the three were
soon munching the sandwiches and crying down
their quality.</p>

<p>“How’s socialism, Brandy?” asked Fowle,
winking at his nearest neighbor. “I hear it’s a
back number nowadays.”</p>

<p>“The socialists are the party of the future,”
said Brandy, solemnly. “The time is coming
when the government will own and operate all
railroads and public utilities, together with all
mines and great industrial plants, and the product
and advantages derived from the resources of
the country will be enjoyed by the people, to
whom they belong, not by the few greedy monopolists
who sit with their feet in the trough at home&mdash;and
send their fat-witted sons to Seaton
Academy.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Taylor. “That’s me! But
look here, Brandy, will the government run the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
hot-dog business too? If it does, where’ll you
be?”</p>

<p>Brandy threw at the interrupter a glance
which was meant to express pity for Taylor’s
ignorance.</p>

<p>“Those that are qualified will hold the important
positions, not those who have a pull. I shall
be chief government inspector of hot dogs.”
Brantwein turned again to his main audience.
“The United States is to-day fifty years behind
Europe in the matter of socialism, but we’re
learning fast now. We must make a beginning
with the coal mines and the great trunk lines&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’ll be bad for you,” cut in Birdie. “You
can’t beat your way from Chicago to Boston, then.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t need to,” retorted Brandy. “The
state will pay for every man’s education. Fellows
like you, of course, the state won’t waste much
time on. You’ll be used for road-menders and
crossing-sweepers.”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” cried Taylor, lacking for the
moment a more effective reply.</p>

<p>“It will be another golden age, won’t it,
Brandy?” interposed Sam, “like that one Virgil
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
tells about, when the pastures were speckled all
over with sheep of different colors, each one producing
wool of just the right tint, so that there
was no need of dyeing it. All the lazy will become
hustlers and all the crooks honest, and
everybody will have what he wants to eat and go
to the theatre every night.”</p>

<p>“Once a term was more than enough for Duncan
Peck,” said the socialist, most irrelevantly.
“That was a hot old bluff he put up on Alsop,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It was no bluff at all,” answered Sam, warmly.
Just then the door was pushed open and Fish
lunged in, gave a general nod that was meant to
include all present, and made a dive for Brandy’s
basket. The socialist proved quite able to defend
his property. He met Fish’s onset with a hard
shove that sent the intruder into the desk, then
picked up his stock in trade and made for the
door. “I can’t waste any more time on you
fellows,” he said. “Fish has come to make a
rough-house and there are about twenty starved
Alumni Hall boarders to be warmed and fed out
of this basket. So long!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>Fish took a newspaper from the desk, punched
a hole through it, and proposed that Fowle wear
it as a collar.</p>

<p>“Get out, won’t you!” pleaded Fowle. “I
don’t want any rough-house here.”</p>

<p>“We’ll put him out, if you say so,” offered Sam.</p>

<p>“No, don’t!” expostulated Birdie. “That’ll
make a row and Alsop will be down on us. He’ll
go.”</p>

<p>Sam and Taylor drifted home to save the
balance of the evening. Fish seized the long-handled
hearth brush which Birdie’s mother, in
the trustfulness of her heart, had sent to her
son with admonition that he keep his fireplace
tidy. “Let me brush your hair,” urged Fish,
advancing on his unwilling host.</p>

<p>“Keep away with that!” Birdie commanded,
but Fish persisted. Each clutched the handle
of the brush and struggled against the other,
Fish to accomplish his purpose, Birdie to ward off
the attack. In the fracas the stick parted; Fish
retained the handle end, Birdie the brush.</p>

<p>“Now see what you’ve done, you hoodlum!”
cried Fowle, indignantly. “Get out of here!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>As Fish showed no inclination to yield to this
order, Birdie threw wide his door, got inside his
enemy, and with a hard buck, given suddenly
and low, tried to rush him out the door. Fish
caught by the casing, pulled himself back, and
ultimately escaped, with a jeer of defiance, to
the farther side of the room. Here Fowle attacked
him again, and by superior strength
dragged him to the door, where Fish by the
skilful use of hands and feet once more blocked
his opponent’s game. By this time Birdie had
undeniably lost both temper and caution. He
grasped the interloper’s wrist with one hand, his
neck with the other, and twisting the wrist and
pressing the neck hard between thumb and
fingers, urged him to the door.</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” cried Fish, quickly. “I’ll go.”</p>

<p>“I won’t trust you,” shouted Fowle. “I
won’t let up an ounce till you’re outside that
door!”</p>

<p>Fish stood not on the order of his going. Outside
Birdie gave him a final push and paused,
panting and dishevelled, in the doorway. Fish
had hardly stretched his cramped neck and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
shaken out his aching wrist, when he suddenly
lifted his head in an attitude of attention, and
darted up the next flight of stairs. While his
ascending head was still visible over the banisters
above, the angry visage of Mr. Alsop appeared
from below.</p>

<p>“At it again, Fowle! Disturbing the whole
well for your own amusement, regardless of the
rights of others and my repeatedly expressed
wishes! There’s a limit, I wish you to understand,
even to my patience.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” stammered the boy, “but this time
it wasn’t my fault.”</p>

<p>“It never is, according to your statements,”
declared the instructor.</p>

<p>“What would you do if a fellow came into your
room, tried to brush your hair with a hearth
brush, broke your things, and refused to leave?
You wouldn’t stand round and let him rip the
room to pieces, would you?”</p>

<p>“Who was it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you, sir.”</p>

<p>“If you prefer to shield him, you can’t blame
me for holding you responsible. Whoever the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
others may be, you are certainly one. If boys
trespass on your room, you should keep your
door locked.”</p>

<p>“I do, usually,” answered Birdie. “Sometimes
I forget.”</p>

<p>“For the rest of the term you are on probation,”
continued the instructor, severely. “At the next
faculty meeting I shall report your case and ask
that a notice be sent to your parents that unless
you can come back to live an orderly, quiet
life in the dormitory, we do not wish you back at
all.”</p>

<p>Overcome by a deep sense of injury, Birdie next
morning confided his troubles to Sam. In consequence,
feeling that the fuel for Mr. Alsop’s ire
must have been provided by the ball game in
which they had had a share, and grasping at a
vague hope of bettering the condition of the
luckless boy, Sam and Taylor visited the teacher
and tried to deflect to themselves some share
of Birdie’s punishment.</p>

<p>“Which of you was the one that forced himself
into Fowle’s room and broke his fire brush?”</p>

<p>“Neither of us,” said Sam.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<p>“But you both played with bat and ball in his
room?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then you may both write out for me before
Saturday night ten pages of French. I ought
to put you on probation, but I will reduce the
punishment in consideration of your confession.”</p>

<p>Sam and Taylor withdrew in gloom. “That’s
what you get for being honest!” groaned Taylor.
“Write out ten pages! That means five hours’
work!”</p>

<p>“And we didn’t help Fowle any, either,” commented
Sam, sadly.</p>

<p>Sam was so depressed by the erratic course of
school justice that he went over to Dr. Leighton’s
that evening and told him the whole story, in
which Fish figured only as “a fellow in the well.”
Dr. Leighton listened with sympathy and gave
what comfort he could. A certain amount of
injustice, he said, is inevitable in our lives; when
we can’t prevent it, it is better to bear it bravely
than to whine over it. Sam went home resolved
to take his punishment without grumbling, and
to hope for better things.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>After the boy left, Dr. Leighton drew out his
catalogue of students and ran rapidly down the
list to discover who belonged in the east well of
Hale. At the name of Fish his pencil rested.
“That’s the black sheep,” he said, as he put away
the pamphlet. “I’m afraid he’s not what Alsop
thinks him.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="medium">HONK! HONK!</span></h2>

<p>The day after Birdie Fowle reached home for
the spring recess, a letter arrived from the Seaton
authorities containing a printed blank, filled in
with an alternation of D’s and E’s. There was
likewise enclosed a short note from the school
secretary, giving the startling information that
the boy’s conduct in the dormitory had been so
reprehensible that he would not be permitted to
return except on trial from day to day; and that
any further complaint from his dormitory master
would be followed by immediate notice to withdraw.</p>

<p>The Fowle household was burdened with sorrow
during the six days which Birdie spent at home.
Mr. Fowle was taciturn and grave, Mrs. Fowle
wept, and Birdie (properly named James), after
a day or two of aggrieved expostulation, settled
into a mood of deeply despondent fatalism.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
He knew that he was not a bad boy; he did not
follow the evil ways of some of his schoolmates;
he did not drink nor play poker nor run in debt
nor cut recitations. Other fellows who did these
and worse got off clear, while for a little rough-housing,
much of which had been forced upon him
by others, he was to be branded as a criminal.
Of what use was it to try to be good, if he got the
punishment of the worst? He might as well be
bad and have the fun of it.</p>

<p>So Birdie returned to school, his ears still
tingling with the stern warnings of his father and
the tearful entreaties of his mother, his heart
saddened by a presentiment of failure. He was
like an unwilling soldier marching to expected
defeat.</p>

<p>Sam and Duncan came back in a very different
state of mind. They had spent the week at the
Archers’ in Portland, where Duncan, who was
on his best behavior, by his deferential politeness
and open-hearted cordiality made amends to the
parents for his early churlish treatment of the
son. The family were charmed with him.</p>

<p>“We are so glad to have had you here,” Mrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
Archer confided to Duncan on the day of their
departure. “We always like to know Sam’s
friends, and we have been interested in you since
Sam first wrote about you.”</p>

<p>At this Duncan looked a trifle conscious, and
shot a swift glance at Sam, whose face was turned
away. “It’s very good of you to let me come,”
he said politely, trying to escape the unpleasant
reminder of the past by dwelling on the agreeable
present.</p>

<p>“He used to write us, you see,” went on Mrs.
Archer, smiling, “that he liked you, but that you
had other friends and did not care for him. I
knew it would be different when you got to know
each other.”</p>

<p>“Was the carriage ordered, mother?” broke in
Sam, most abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes, for two o’clock,” Mrs. Archer rejoined,
and turned again to her guest. “I was disappointed
when Sam proposed to bring down
Mulcahy, whom I did not know at all, and not
you whom I had met and wanted to see more of.
Is Mulcahy one of your friends, too?”</p>

<p>“Not a very intimate one,” replied Duncan.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<p>“He must be a very remarkable young man.”
She addressed herself again to the uneasy Sam.
“But you haven’t said much about him lately,
Sam. What has become of him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s around,” answered the son of the
house, unpleasantly reminded of the superlatives
which he had used in his early letters in describing
Mulcahy. “Didn’t you say you were going
to hand over some of that cake to take back
with us, mother?”</p>

<p>“Katy’s doing it up now. Shall I tell her to
put in some strawberry jam?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Archer rustled out on her errand, leaving the
boys alone. Sam picked up a magazine which lay on
the table, and turned the pages of advertisements.</p>

<p>“I did treat you pretty rocky that fall term,”
remarked Duncan, as if their differences during
Sam’s first months in school had been the topic
of conversation. “I acted like a mick.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think of it,” returned Sam, without
looking up. “I was a fool.”</p>

<p>And this was all the reference ever made to
their early disagreement.</p>

<p>Birdie Fowle’s melancholy fatalism lasted about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
a fortnight. By the end of that time, having
been successful in keeping his door locked and
having received two C’s on half-hour exams, he
began to feel better. His old cheerfulness returned,
and with it a measure of carelessness.
Sam, who was trying to help him, had urged him
to avoid John Fish and give the dormitory scourge
no excuse for enmity. It was clear, even to our
inexperienced young man, that Fish’s cunning
was not keeping pace with his effrontery. Success
in deceiving his dormitory master had stimulated
the fellow’s audacity to the point of recklessness;
sooner or later he would expose himself.</p>

<p>Birdie, though accepting readily this rule of conduct,
was hardly capable of carrying it out. On
April first, the day of fools, he was tempted and
fell. It happened in this wise. As he started
down toward the post-office after his morning
recitation, he saw John Fish sauntering in the
same direction a dozen yards ahead of him.
Obedient to the advice of his counsellor to keep
out of Fish’s way, Birdie checked his own pace and
trailed along behind. In front of the post-office
stood a dozen fellows gossiping and looking out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
upon the street. When Fish was two-thirds
across, Birdie’s good resolution yielded in an
instant to the inspiration of the opportunity.
He opened his mouth, hardened his throat muscles,
and forced out two harshly resonant syllables.</p>

<p>Birdie’s “honk! honk!” was a masterpiece
of mimicry for which he was justly famous.
No one in school could perpetrate anything approaching
it in effectiveness. Barney and Litchell
had developed a fair imitation that would
deceive the inexperienced; Fowle could frighten
the elect. Fish, whose mind was intent on the
question of how best to spend a certain expected
check&mdash;if he repaid the money he had borrowed
from various boys, he would have nothing left&mdash;gave
a great clumsy plunge forward, like a startled
dray-horse. His cap flew from his head; his
books dropped from his hand. Safe at the
curbstone, he turned to throw a malediction on
the reckless motorist, and looked into Fowle’s
gleeful face.</p>

<p>“April fool!” sang Birdie, cheerfully.</p>

<p>The fellows on the sidewalk hooted. Fish
went back to gather up his property. “You’re
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
a clever child,” he said, smiling contemptuously.
His look was more significant than his words.</p>

<p>In five minutes Birdie was aware that he had
committed a sad error. Fish in good-nature was
always a menace to peace; Fish offended would
be an unscrupulous enemy. Disheartened, Fowle
took his troubles again to Sam.</p>

<p>“You were a fool to do that,” expostulated
Sam. “I told you to let him alone.”</p>

<p>“I tried to,” mourned Birdie, “but it was such
a slick chance!”</p>

<p>“Well, as long as you can keep him out of the
room, it’ll be all right. You aren’t afraid to tackle
him in the open.”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” returned Fowle, emphatically.
“If I could get him outside, I wouldn’t put up
with anything from him!”</p>

<p>“Then if he gets in, order him out; if he won’t
go, tell him you’ll hold him responsible for everything
he does in the room, and get out yourself.”</p>

<p>“A lot of good that will do! He’d plug the
gas jets, pour water in the bed, write things on
my collars, and spoil things generally. And if
I stayed, he’d be likely to do something to make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
me mad, and I’d wade into him. Then rough-house,
noise, and home I’d go.”</p>

<p>It was indeed a hard problem that poor Birdie
faced: if he defended himself against aggression,
he committed <i>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</i> against Mr. Alsop by
having a rough-house, and the sentence hanging
over him would be executed; if he endured in
patience, his possessions would be wrecked before
his eyes; if he reported the facts, he transgressed
the one law of which all schoolboys, good and bad,
despise the breaker.</p>

<p>“Come down here the next time he gets in,”
proposed Sam, at length, “and let me go up and
settle him. You can prove an alibi if anything
happens, and I’m not on probation.”</p>

<p>A fortnight passed. Sam, busy with studies
and track practice, had ceased to think of Birdie
as in immediate danger. Moorhead, Fish’s unfortunate
room-mate, had proposed to room with
Sam the next year, and Sam, feeling that it would
be better for him to live with the quiet, studious
scholar than with some more lively but less helpful
chum, had consented. The interests of the present
and plans for the future absorbed his attention.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
He was gaining in French and in Mr. Alsop’s
esteem; he was really beginning to hope for a
recommendation in the subject for the college
preliminaries. Collins kept him encouraged in
the hurdles. Unless some better man appeared,
he seemed sure of a place on the track team as
Fairmount’s understudy. Altogether he felt satisfied
with himself and at peace with the world.</p>

<p>But it is hard to keep at peace with the world,
if the world makes unjust war upon one’s friends.
Fowle, returning to his room from Greek one
morning, neglected to secure his door. He
hadn’t been in his desk chair ten minutes when
some one pushed the door open, looked in, and
cried, “Honk, honk!” It was Fish!</p>

<p>“Keep out!” called Fowle. “I’m on pro.”</p>

<p>“That don’t scare me,” said Fish, as he shut
the door behind him and sauntered across the room.</p>

<p>On the table lay the first sheet of a theme,
neatly copied. Fish dipped a pen in the ink,
and shook a blot on the outspread page.</p>

<p>“Oh, excuse me,” he said. “I was going to
correct it;” and he dropped another blot beside
the first.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<p>“Look here, Fish!” spoke Fowle, sharply, “I
don’t want you here. Clear out!”</p>

<p>“You’re not very polite,” returned the visitor,
unabashed, as he threw the pen, point downward,
at the table, and picking up a couple of
magazines and a book, began rearing a triangular
steeple on the lamp chimney.</p>

<p>Birdie’s ire was waxing. He felt that he could
not control himself much longer. “Will you go
or not?” he demanded hotly.</p>

<p>“I’ll go when I get ready,” answered Fish,
watching closely to see how high Birdie’s temperature
was rising, taking care meanwhile to
keep the table between them. He did not want
to get Fowle into a dangerously pugnacious
state; he merely wished to incite a good lively
rough-house, in which the smashing of a few
trifles would be unavoidable.</p>

<p>Instead, however, of reaching over the table
for his tormentor or chasing him round it, Fowle
took an unexpected course. He turned and
walked out of the room, slamming the door behind
him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<span class="medium">HOW THE FISH WAS CAUGHT</span></h2>

<p>Fish stood gazing with stupid astonishment
at the closed door for some seconds after the sound
of Birdie’s footsteps had died away. He was
alone, with no check whatever upon his Hunnish
craving for mauling and smashing. Yet mauling
and smashing <i>in se</i> were not what delighted the
heart of John Fish. He liked to stroll about a
room when its occupants were at home, and goad
them gradually into a destructive fray. He
liked to do accidental damage under the eyes
of the sufferers. In the corner near the door of
Fowle’s bedroom had once stood a handsome
and solid chair. By sitting in this chair whenever
he came in, by tipping it back on its hind
legs and wrenching it and twisting it with silent
disregard of the protests of its owner, he had at
last brought it to complete collapse&mdash;of course,
unintentionally. In the embroidered scarf which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
hung from the mantelpiece were two big scorch-rimmed
holes; here he had accidentally held a
lighted cigarette behind him as he stood in front
of the fireplace. He had enjoyed himself in this
room, but always in the presence of spectators.
The pleasure of laying waste dwindled to nothing,
if the victims were not on hand to expostulate
and mourn. He really was at a loss what to do
with his liberty.</p>

<p>While he was still ruminating, the door flew
open and Sam Archer rushed in. The new-comer
threw his coat into a corner, turned up his cuffs,
and opened the door. Then he spoke, briefly
and to the point, “Get out!”</p>

<p>Fish looked across the table into Archer’s
face and recognized there an expression different
from that worn by the challenger to an amicable
rough-and-tumble. He had no mind for a serious
set-to with the vanquisher of the redoubtable
boxer Runyon, neither did he wish to retire
tamely before a mere threat.</p>

<p>“Get out yourself!” he answered. “It isn’t
your room.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s Fowle’s room, and he wants you out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
of it. You know well enough that rough-housing
will fire him. I’m here in his place. Now, beat
it!”</p>

<p>“I’ll go when I get ready,” growled Fish in
return.</p>

<p>They began circling the table. As Fish passed
the door, he slammed it to. When Sam reached
it, he opened it again and shoved a heavy arm-chair
against it. Then he removed the lamp
to the mantelpiece, and made another half turn
round the table. This movement brought Fish
near the door again. He stooped over to swing
aside the arm-chair which kept the door open,
and at the same moment Sam vaulted the barrier.</p>

<p>As Fish beheld his assailant’s long legs swinging
over the edge of the table in a hurdler’s leap,
and the sinewy body bearing down upon him,
it flashed into his brain, and from his brain with
instantaneous impulse into nerves and muscles,
that by dodging the frontal attack and delivering
an immediate rear charge, he could put Archer
himself out of the room and close the door upon
him. His dodge, however, was not quite quick
-----File: 249.png&mdash;-
-----File: 250.png&mdash;-
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
enough. The hurdler came down with long
arms flying, and one of these flying arms, or the
clenched fist attached to it, as it swung up,
caught the ducking Fish under the eye. It was
an unintentional blow, but it had force, and Fish
went back against the door-post, for a moment
dazed. When he got to his feet again, he found
himself in the entry. The door was locked behind
him; over the banisters he beheld the
head of the descending Archer.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">At the same moment Sam vaulted the barrier.</span>&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_228">Page 228</a>.</i></p></div>

<p>On the second floor at the foot of the stairs
Mr. Alsop was standing, peering suspiciously upwards.
“Another disturbance in Fowle’s room,
I judge,” he said, frowning.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain, sir, if you’ll let me,” said Sam,
breathing hard. “Won’t you come in here?”</p>

<p>He threw open his door and let the teacher
pass in ahead of him.</p>

<p>“Now, what is it?” said Mr. Alsop, when they
were inside.</p>

<p>“It’s this,” responded Sam. “Fowle has been
trying his best to keep his probation and live
up to the faculty’s orders. This morning a
fellow came into his room to stir up a rough-house,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
and Fowle, knowing that he couldn’t keep out of
it if he stayed at home, cut out and left the fellow
there. He’s over in the library now.”</p>

<p>“Who is, Fowle or the fellow who came to
rough-house?” asked Mr. Alsop, sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Fowle! He stopped on his way down and
told me about it; I went up and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And what?”</p>

<p>“Threw the fellow out,” continued Sam. “I
had to, or he’d have smashed everything in the
room.”</p>

<p>Mr. Alsop smiled with an air of incredulity.
Sam drew himself up to his full six feet. The
look of wounded self-respect that he flashed into
the teacher’s face was unmistakably real.</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t believe me,” he said
proudly. “If you will go to the library, you’ll
find Fowle there. He’ll let you into the room,
and you’ll see my coat just as I dropped it.”</p>

<p>“I have not said that I don’t believe you. I
do believe you,” interposed Mr. Alsop, hastily.
“You probably would not care to tell me who
this intruder was?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I couldn’t,” returned Sam. “I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
don’t believe he’ll come again,” he added, looking
ruefully at his knuckles, still numb from the
blow which had felled the audacious Fish. “I
didn’t mean to say anything against anybody.
I just wanted to have you know that Birdie&mdash;that
Fowle&mdash;wasn’t in it at all.”</p>

<p>Mr. Alsop felt no disposition to discuss Fowle.
Having frequently proclaimed the young man to
be the pernicious influence in his domain, he
did not like to acknowledge that he had erred.
He therefore contented himself with repeating
certain hackneyed sentiments as to the responsibility
for order in the well and the offended
spirit of the school,&mdash;and withdrew.</p>

<p>As far as his dormitory master was concerned,
Fish certainly possessed a charmed life. When
he appeared the next day with the darkly obvious
marks of a bruise about his right eye, he had no
difficulty in drawing upon Mr. Alsop’s sympathies
by his explanation of the flying ring which had
struck him in the face in the gymnasium. It did
not occur to the instructor to put together the
fact of the black eye and Sam’s account of the
forcible expulsion of a trespasser.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>This example of the unique way in which order
was maintained in his well, Mr. Alsop repeated
with satisfaction to several of his colleagues,
among others to Dr. Leighton.</p>

<p>“And you have no suspicion as to who this
rough-houser was?” asked Dr. Leighton.</p>

<p>“None whatever.”</p>

<p>“Have you noticed Fish’s black eye?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he got that in the gymnasium from a
flying ring. Bad bruise, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“There seems to be a different version about
that eye going round the school. They charge
it up to some fracas with another boy.”</p>

<p>“They would anyway,” replied Mr. Alsop,
sagely. “Boys always joke over a black eye.
Fish told me all about it himself.”</p>

<p>The comment on Dr. Leighton’s lips remained
unspoken. He had his own opinion as to Fish,
formed from investigations which were not yet
complete. He did not wish to hazard his plan
by setting Alsop to pounding along the trail.
If his suspicions were well founded, Fish would
sooner or later betray himself.</p>

<p>Fish had grown incautious. Of late he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
taken to keeping liquors in his room. He had
found an excellent hiding-place, the pedal compartment
at the bottom of Moorhead’s piano.
It was closed by a lid which swung down on
hinges set at the lower edge. Moorhead came
in one day just in season to find Fish closing the
door of this borrowed cupboard.</p>

<p>“What are you doing to my piano?” he demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>“Nothing, just seeing how it works.”</p>

<p>Moorhead went straight to the piano, and
opening the compartment, discovered Fish’s two
bottles and a glass.</p>

<p>“Do you call that nothing?” he asked, reddening
with anger.</p>

<p>“Yee-up, I do,” answered Fish, complacently.
“The faculty might not.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want them there, do you hear?”
announced Moorhead. “I don’t want to be
mixed up with the things at all.”</p>

<p>“They won’t do any hurt. Nobody ever opens
the place.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care!” retorted Moorhead. “I won’t
have them there.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

<p>“Oh yes, you will,” Fish answered complacently,
and went about his own affairs as if the matter
were settled.</p>

<p>A few hours later Fish discovered his precious
bottles on the floor in the back of his closet.
He restored them to their appointed place in
the piano, and lay in wait for Moorhead.</p>

<p>“You dirty little scut!” he shouted, as the
rebel appeared. “Didn’t I tell you to leave
those bottles alone?”</p>

<p>“I said I wouldn’t have them in my piano,”
faltered Moorhead.</p>

<p>“And I said you were to leave ’em alone. You
might as well have handed ’em over to Lady
Jane while you were about it. If you touch ’em
again, you’ll find your pretty music box there
scratched from top to bottom.”</p>

<p>And Moorhead, who knew what Fish was
capable of, gave heed to the threat and held his
tongue.</p>

<p>It was not long after this that slow-moving
justice at last overtook Mr. John Fish. One
morning when Moorhead was just starting for
breakfast, he noticed that the lid of the piano
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
compartment was down. Feeling under no obligation
either to replace the lid, or to remove the
chair which screened it from the casual observer,
he took his book from the top of the piano and
went his way. At the clang of the first chapel
bell, Fish crawled forth from bed and for the
next seven minutes devoted his energies exclusively
to the task of throwing on his clothes
and getting into chapel before the second bell
ceased to ring. He had no leisure to waste in
idle contemplation of his study.</p>

<p>The chambermaid, making her rounds, observed
the bottles and called the matron. The
matron came, closed the lid, and reported to Mr.
Alsop. Mr. Alsop, scandalized and incredulous,
made an examination of the premises and demanded
an explanation separately from each
occupant of the room. Each disclaimed ownership
of the bottles. Fish declared, in addition,
that he did not even know that there was any
such cupboard in the piano; Moorhead acknowledged
that he knew that the bottles were there,
but would give no information as to their owner.
As the piano belonged to Moorhead, Mr. Alsop
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
was inclined to hold him either the criminal or
an accomplice.</p>

<p>But this time the truth proved stronger than
the lie. When the matter came before the faculty,
every individual teacher to whom Moorhead
recited conducted himself like an attorney engaged
to defend him. After Dr. Leighton brought
forward the report of his investigation into Fish’s
manner of life, the august body voted that Fish
be dismissed; and the yea vote was so overwhelming
that Mr. Alsop did not venture to
raise a dissenting voice. The evidence that
came to light a few days after the disgraced student
left town, evidence which showed that Mr. Alsop
had been shamelessly imposed on since the
beginning of the year, was a severe blow to that
gentleman’s self-esteem.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<span class="medium">LESSONS IN HURDLING</span></h2>

<p>With the departure of Fish, the east well of
Hale ceased to be a scene of mysteriously fomented
disturbance. Mr. Alsop, having been wofully
betrayed through blind following of his own
prejudices, resolved to be more cautious in forming
opinions in the future, and less hasty in the
performance of duty. He had yet to learn that a
teacher may make a reputation in a week which
he cannot live down in the whole subsequent school
life of his pupils.</p>

<p>For Sam now began the busiest, most exciting
period of the year. The college examinations
were near enough to render devotion to lessons
a matter of personal advantage; the outdoor
school meet and the track contest with Hillbury
challenged his zeal and ambition. Besides these
serious interests, May and June offered their
usual lavish opportunities for innocent but distracting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
amusement, ranging from tennis and
scrub ball games and long walks, to the convention
of wags, wits, and philosophers, which
gathered every pleasant evening after dinner on
the high steps of Carter, and intermittently sang
songs and discussed men and things&mdash;mostly
men&mdash;to the vast entertainment of the listeners.
Here Brantwein, released for the time from the
burden of the peanut basket, was a protagonist,
with socialism as a general theme and every
exposed head as a target for his verbal shillaleh.
The crowd yelled applause for every crack he gave,
and lavished double measure on every telling
return.</p>

<p>Good practice in the high hurdles amounts to
something more than daily exercise in starting,
running, and jumping. The course is one hundred
and twenty yards over ten hurdles, with fifteen
yards clear before the first, and fifteen more after
the last. Between each pair of hurdles lies a
distance of ten yards; each barrier is three feet
and six inches high. The runner must clear the
barrier in such a way as to interrupt his advance
as little as possible, by rising neither too high
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
nor too low, by taking his jump neither too long
nor too short, by landing in the right position, by
adjusting his inter-hurdle strides to the distance
and to his own powers. It has been known
since the race was first practised that the average
man must take three strides between hurdles;
but the length of the jump, and the proper arrangement
of short and long strides, are even now
matters of dispute.</p>

<p>Collins’s theory, which of course Sam followed,
was that the jump should be short rather than
long. He insisted that to prolong the distance
covered while in the air on the force of previous
effort is to cut short the opportunity to use the
legs; to overjump is to introduce into the race a
series of dead periods when the runner is passively
waiting for his feet to touch the ground before he
can become active again. So the trainer labored
with Sam to bring him over the hurdle to the ground
at the earliest possible moment; to teach him the
quick rotary whirl of the legs that neither drags
nor interferes with the step, the forward leg
doubled and slightly swung, the other brought
quickly around after it in a wide arc; to force
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
him to take the landing step short&mdash;in order to
bring his feet under him&mdash;and to stretch the
other two strides. Sam’s handicap was his
slowness and a tendency to make his strides too
long. His advantage lay in staying power; he
could do twelve hurdles as well as ten. So the
clever trainer worked him day after day on starts
and over two or three hurdles, and once a week
sent him over eleven.</p>

<p>“You don’t put me over the course enough, it
seems to me,” complained Sam, one day. “I’m
tired of that everlasting thirty-five yards.”</p>

<p>“If you can do two hurdles right, you can do
ten,” answered Collins, calmly. “If you can’t
do the first two, you can’t do any.”</p>

<p>“I should say that it’s speed between that I
lack,” pursued Sam. “I get over the hurdles
pretty well, but I lose momentum somewhere
between jumps.”</p>

<p>“You take your first step too long, as I keep
telling you. Four to five feet is all you ought to
cover in that first stride after the hurdle. If
you come down right and take the first step right,
you can put speed into the other two and get just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
the right take-off to drop you over the next hurdle.
Speed will come in time.”</p>

<p>“I wish it would!” lamented Sam.</p>

<p>“It isn’t all in fast running,” said Collins,
“nor half. Taking the hurdles is the main thing.
There’s really only two running steps between,
if you throw out the short step. And what a fast
runner makes in those two steps, he’ll more than
lose on the hurdles, if he doesn’t do ’em right.
Three feet lost on a hurdle is thirty feet on the
race, a good second and a fifth. No one wins a
race by that much. The work that’s cut out for
you is to get your jump so near perfect that you
don’t lose anything in going over. Then just
steady, hard running will put you ahead of the
fellow who hasn’t your staying power.”</p>

<p>“We all seem to have about the same amount of
that.”</p>

<p>Collins hesitated. His first impulse was to
deny Sam’s statement; his second to let it go
unchallenged. After all, there was nothing so
important for Sam’s progress as that he should
continue to think that everything depended on
hard, steady work. Sam was one who could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
stand work. While he was occasionally discouraged,
he never became despondent; he did
not grow irritable under defeat nor refractory
at criticism. He disclaimed high expectations,
smiled at discomfiture, and plodded on.</p>

<p>The school meet came and went, bringing little
glory to the name of Archer. That Fairmount
would beat him in the hurdles, Sam fully expected.
The start was fairly even, but Fairmount was in
the air above the first hurdle when Sam was leaving
the ground on his first spring; at the fifth Fairmount
was yards ahead. Yet at the tenth,
strange to say, Sam had almost caught him.
Archer finished less than two yards behind the
leader, and fully six ahead of Sanderson, his
nearest pursuer. Fairmount’s time was sixteen
and four-fifths. So Sam, according to Collins’s
estimate, had come close to seventeen seconds, a
gain of at least a second by a year’s work. From
this result, with which the trainer was fully satisfied,
Sam was at least inclined to draw more consolation
than discouragement. He had still another
school year before him.</p>

<p>It was his defeat in the pole vault which caused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
him the most chagrin. Jones, of course, rose like
a bird soaring against the wind; his light, lithe
body arched the rod gracefully at ten feet, six.
Sam surmounted nine feet, six&mdash;but Mulcahy
reached nine feet, ten. It was not jealousy that
beset the defeated vaulter, nor wounded pride,
nor the mean ill-will that grudges success to a
rival. Sam’s heart had harbored only feelings
of congratulation towards Fairmount, who had
beaten him in the hurdles; his enthusiasm over
Jones’s achievements was genuine and whole-souled.
These two were sportsmen through and
through, to whom the joy of the contest, the
delight of winning, the promise of gaining points
for the school in the meet with Hillbury, constituted
the whole stimulus and reward. Mulcahy
cared for none of these things. At heart it
mattered not two straws to him whether the blue
or the red triumphed, as long as his own advance
was assured. To Mulcahy, athletics were but a
ladder by which he could mount, the means
necessary to a desired end. He wanted prominence
in school, distinction, prizes. He wanted
the Yale Cup as the crowning honor of his school
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
career. To win this, he professed an enthusiasm
for athletics, as the unscrupulous politician professes
the principles that win votes.</p>

<p>Ten days later Sam took part in his first contest
with Hillbury. In the interval he did some
work in preparation for the event which is not set
down in the coaching directions. When Collins
received from the secretary of the Academy the
list of those whose work was “up” and who were
therefore allowed to compete, the names of Fairmount
and Chouder were missing. There was
a hurried consultation with the faculty, resulting
in the announcement that if the backward work
were made up to the satisfaction of teachers by
the day before the games, the prohibition on the
two men would be removed. Bruce called upon
Mulcahy, who was known to have had experience
in tutoring. Mulcahy could not possibly
find time for extra work. Then Sam undertook
the case of Fairmount, and Moorhead volunteered
to coach Chouder. Both tutors labored
early and late to bring their charges into a condition
acceptable to the authorities. Moorhead
had the more difficult task, for Chouder was behind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
in two subjects, and learning came harder to his
slow, unreceptive mind than chopping wood or
running races to his sinewy body. It was Moorhead’s
first opportunity to do something tangible
for the school athletics, and he gave the best that
was in him, freely and patiently, hour after hour,
oblivious to the fact that there could be no public
recognition of his service, no personal glory in
victory. Fairmount triumphed over his geometry
with a C, while Chouder, to his infinite
satisfaction and the relief of his anxious tutor,
scraped through his examinations on a brace
of D’s.</p>

<p>So it happened that Moorhead, as he perched
high on the cheering section at the Hillbury
games, felt that he had more part in the contests
than those who sat about him, mere longing hearts
and vociferous units in the chorus. When Chouder
took the two-twenty yards from Merton of Hillbury,
running from the start like a predestined
victor, Moorhead thrilled with the consciousness
that it was in part his race and his victory. In
the low hurdles his candidate was not so successful,
as the redoubtable Kilham of Hillbury led at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
finish, though Chouder pressed him hard. Fay
and Shirley had to content themselves with second
and third places in the hundred yards, but Bruce
won the quarter in a grand burst of speed that cut
the time down close to fifty seconds, and Weatherford
made sure of the half-mile. Jones sailed
deftly over the vaulting bar at ten feet, seven,
with Mulcahy a safe third at nine feet, eight.
And old Brandy Brantwein, feeling unusually
free from the trammels of society by reason of
the absence of the peanut basket, showed what
socialism will do for a man by throwing the hammer
four feet beyond the best cast of the Hillbury
individualist, and putting himself into second
place in the shot contest.</p>

<p>The general issue was already decided when
the high hurdles were called. Seaton had won.
Under the inspiration of victory, Sam felt that
he, too, might achieve something worth while.
His start was good, but at the second hurdle the
two outside men, Kilham and Fairmount, were
already ahead of him. At the fourth they were
still farther ahead, but he pressed steadily on,
clearing his hurdles by two inches, dropping short
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
and driving himself forward with the routine
pace. At the seventh hurdle only Kilham kept
his distance; Fairmount was nearer. The tenth
he passed at Fairmount’s side, with Kilham but
a stride beyond. In the finish, Fairmount sprinted
better and gained a yard, but was still behind the
leader by the thickness of his body.</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t coached up Fairmount so that he
could pass his condition, you’d have been second
in that race instead of third,” remarked Duncan,
as they discussed the events of the day, after the
celebration.</p>

<p>“And we should have lost one point,” answered
Sam.</p>

<p>“One point wouldn’t have made any difference
in the result. You deserved second, anyhow,
by the way you’ve worked. Fairmount will be
gone next year, and then you’ll have things
your own way.”</p>

<p>“There’s Kilham,” said Sam, wistfully. “He’s
only an upper middler. He’ll be in Hillbury next
year and beat me out again; then he’ll go to Yale
and I to Harvard, and he’ll beat me four years
more. That’s what I’m up against!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<p>“Oh, cheer up!” returned Duncan. “You’ve
improved a lot this year. You may beat him all
to pieces next year. They said that your race
to-day was in mighty good time, and you weren’t
much behind Kilham.”</p>

<p>Sam shook his head with a smile of resignation.
“I haven’t won a thing this year, and I probably
shan’t do any better next, but I’m going to keep
right on. I’m too much used to losing to mind,
and there’s always a chance that by a fluke I may
win something.”</p>

<p>“It’s a shame!” thought Duncan to himself.
“I’d never coach a fellow up just so that he could
take a prize from me, if the school never won an
extra point.”

<span class="medium">ROBERT OWEN, FRESHMAN</span></h2>

<p>On the Monday following the Hillbury games,
Duncan rushed in with a letter in his hand, and an
eager look on his face.</p>

<p>“Look here, Sam! Bob Owen’s sent me two
tickets to the Harvard-Yale Freshman ball game
on Wednesday. Do you suppose they’d let us
off to go?”</p>

<p>“Who’s us?”</p>

<p>“You and me.”</p>

<p>Sam’s eyes sparkled. “Wouldn’t it be great!
Good seats?”</p>

<p>“Right behind the back-stop. Just think of
seeing Owen bucking against McPherson and
Hayes! O’Brien, who used to pitch for Hillbury,
is going to be in the box for the Harvard Freshies,
and several old Hillbury men are playing with
Yale. It’s a queer jumble; Seaton catcher and
Hillbury pitcher against a mixed mess,&mdash;half
of them old Seaton and Hillbury fellows.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think you’d care much who wins,”
observed Sam. “You’ve got friends on both sides.”</p>

<p>“I do care,” answered Duncan. “I’m with the
Harvard lot every time, and you are, too, only
I’ve got more reason for my stand than you have.
It’s Don’s class and Bob Owen’s class, and old
Bob’s captain.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope his nine will win. The Yale
fellows beat ’em in football, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Bob was on the eleven. He’s
aching to get back at them. It’ll be a hot old
game, all right. The only question is whether
we can break away to see it. Who’s the most
likely prof for you to tackle? You’ll have to get
the permissions. I haven’t a pull with a single
man in the faculty, worse luck!”</p>

<p>It was decided that Sam should try to win Dr.
Leighton to the cause, and through the strong
influence of the teacher float Duncan’s uncertain
craft across the bar. Duncan suggested various
subtle methods of appealing to Dr. Leighton’s
favor, but Sam preferred a simple, straightforward
course,&mdash;which was unquestionably the best one.
He called on his patron saint of the faculty that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
afternoon, explained to him with eager enthusiasm
the special opportunity which had been offered,
urged that neither had had out-of-town leave for
a long time, and promised, if they were allowed
to go, not only exemplary conduct while absent,
but compensation in diligent work on their return.
Dr. Leighton smiled a little mournfully at this
conception of diligence in school work as a favor
granted to a teacher, and promised to think the
matter over and do what he conscientiously could.
Sam departed, greatly encouraged.</p>

<p>Two circumstances counted in favor of the boys’
request: the fact that the invitation came from
Robert Owen, for whom Dr. Leighton cherished a
sincere regard, and his full confidence in Sam.
He believed, moreover, that an honest petition
for a legitimate purpose from an honest boy
should receive at least as much consideration as
some fictitious excuse of necessity trumped up
to satisfy a formal rule. More than once, as he
was sadly aware, had A’s candid request been
refused by the authorities, when B, who followed
with a lie on his lips, obtained a permission which
was used for precisely the same purpose. Dr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
Leighton’s commendation carried weight at the
office.</p>

<p>They boarded the eleven o’clock train, jubilant
in spirit as any schoolboy released for a lark, but
self-contained as conscious Seatonians, who pride
themselves on being above the “kiddishness”
of minor schools. In Boston they snatched a
hasty lunch and took a car for Cambridge. The
car filled quickly. The Harvard track meet was
to be held in the Stadium at the same time with
the Freshman game on the ball field, and many
outsiders were tending Cambridgeward. On
Boylston Street a large, serious-faced young man
climbed upon the running board of the car, and
looking calmly over the crowded seats to spy
out an unoccupied place, winked solemnly at a
familiar face.</p>

<p>“Look, there’s old Brandy!” exclaimed Sam,
nudging Duncan sharply in the ribs. “How did
he get here?”</p>

<p>“How does he get anywhere?” retorted Duncan.
“On his cheek, of course.”</p>

<p>Brantwein swung himself along to the seat
occupied by Sam and Duncan. He was dressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
in his best, and carried himself with a noticeable
air of importance.</p>

<p>“Going out to the game?” he asked coolly.</p>

<p>“Yes, are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to something, I don’t know what.
Either the track or to see the freshmen play.”</p>

<p>“How did you get off?” questioned Sam.</p>

<p>“I had business in Boston.”</p>

<p>“Buying peanuts?”</p>

<p>Brandy smiled. It was his regular armor-plated
smile against which all personal jokes
fell dead and harmless. “No, buying a peanut
farm and a burying-ground for fools. I’ve got
to lay out about a dozen up there at Seaton
before I leave. You fellows are feeling lively
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re going to see Owen beat Coy again.”</p>

<p>“Do you expect to see that?”</p>

<p>“We hope so.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but I’ll go there, too,” said Brantwein,
meditatively.</p>

<p>“You may not be able to get a seat now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care about seats.”</p>

<p>The three approached the entrance to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
grounds together, but there in the crowd Brantwein
disappeared. Our friends gave little heed
to the movements of their eccentric schoolmate,
being taken up with the pleasant excitement of
the quest of places. Duncan hailed several fellows
whom he knew, and pointed out several
others whom he knew about. While they were
waiting for the nines to appear, with Duncan
still busy over his search for familiar faces, Sam’s
eyes fell upon a well-known figure seated on one
of the benches reserved within the side lines for
coaches and old players.</p>

<p>“Look there, Duncan,” he cried, “on the first
bench on the side line! Isn’t that Brandy?”</p>

<p>“As sure as guns!” returned Duncan. “How
did he get there?”</p>

<p>“Search me!” returned Sam. “He has the
most colossal nerve! He told me once that with a
two-foot rule in his hand he could get into any
building going up,&mdash;construction work, he called
it,&mdash;even if a man stood at the door to keep
people out. Perhaps Owen let him in.”</p>

<p>“Owen nothing!” retorted Duncan. “He’s
worked one of his bluffs on the ticket-taker.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
One of these days his nerve’ll carry him inside a
jail.” Duncan did not fancy Brantwein, even as
an amusement.</p>

<p>But the players were appearing, and Brantwein
and his arts were forgotten.</p>

<p>“That’s Owen, the solid fellow with the white
sweater, and the mask on his arm,” cried Duncan;
“and the tall fellow behind him is O’Brien, the
Hillbury man. The one just going out to left
field is Latter. He played on our nine last year.”</p>

<p>He paused to watch the men taking their positions
for practice.</p>

<p>“There come the Yale fellows!” exclaimed
Sam, whose gaze was wandering over the field.
“Now, which is McPherson?”</p>

<p>Duncan hesitated for some time; the unfamiliar
uniforms confused him. “I think that’s McPherson
over by third base,” he said. The man at
third took a short bound and shot it underhand
to a companion. “Yes, that’s Mac. I should
know that twist of the shoulder in California.
Isn’t it a shame!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Why, that he should be playing under Coy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
against Bob Owen. In the Hillbury game last
year Coy came near assaulting Mac for tagging
him too hard at second. Now they’re pals.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything strange in that,” rejoined
Sam. “He’s playing for his college as Owen’s
playing for ours.”</p>

<p>So they chattered on, till the Harvard men took
the field for the game and a businesslike pair of
blue-stockinged legs appeared beneath a bat at
the plate. Then they watched with straining
eyes, their talk running to brief exclamations,
sighs for the discouraging gains of the visitors,
vain cries of exultation when the Harvard men
made promising plays.</p>

<p>Three innings passed without a run on either
side. Then Coy, the first man up in the fourth,
hit a bounder which the Harvard third baseman
found too hot to handle, and Coy beat the ball
to first base. The next man waited while O’Brien
tried to tempt the runner to steal, and thus got
his base on balls. His successor hit to third again,
and while Manning hesitated and tried to touch
Coy, likewise made first. Number four went out
on a long fly to right field, but the speedy Coy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
got safely across the plate on the return throw,
with score number one. McPherson now made
a lucky single over shortstop’s head, which
brought in a second run. Then O’Brien caught
the Yale man playing off too far from second, and
the next batsman struck out.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i279" src="images/i279.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“<span class="smcap">That’s Owen.</span>”&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_255">Page 255</a>.</i></p></div>

<p>“Bad!” said Duncan, sadly. His unhappiness
was not relieved when the three Harvard men went
out on a fly and two easy infield hits.</p>

<p>“They’re finding the ball, anyway,” remarked
Sam, trying to be courageous; “the game’s
young yet.”</p>

<p>“It’s nearly half grown,” rejoined Duncan,
gloomily; “and you can see what kind of a beast
it’s going to be. Two runs is an awful handicap.”</p>

<p>He was depressed still further in the fifth
inning, when the first ball pitched yielded a hit
that put a Yale man again on first. The Yale
coachers took a risk and bade their man steal
second. It was a poor risk, for Owen shot one of
his perfect throws down ahead of the runner, and
Williams, the Harvard shortstop, thumped him
with the ball as he slid gallantly into his fate.</p>

<p>“What a daisy throw!” cried Sam, ecstatically.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<p>“He can do those by the dozen,” remarked
Duncan, airily. “He has a special wire to second
base.”</p>

<p>Manning now captured a foul off third, and
Latter took a long fly in left field. A Harvard
man got as far as second base and was left
there. The sixth inning profited neither side.</p>

<p>The seventh began with another shock to our
friends’ nerves. Bryant made a two-bagger.
His two successors, however, went out on hits to
O’Brien, and presently Bryant himself, working
too far from his base, was cut off by a sudden
throw to second, and run down ignominiously
between second and third.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Owen, do something!” muttered
Duncan, as the Harvard catcher came to the plate.
Owen responded to the unheard appeal by a hot
bounder over second which the Yale centre fielder
allowed to bounce past him, thus helping the
runner to second. Williams drove a troublesome
ball into McPherson’s hands, and while the
old Seaton second baseman was struggling to get
hold of it, Owen reached third and Williams
crossed first. The Harvard freshies now tried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
a squeeze play, and Manning not only met the
ball, but made a pretty little hit over Bryant’s
head, that would have brought Owen in, if he had
not already crossed the plate. A sacrifice now
advanced Williams and Manning to third and
second. Then Gooding, the Yale pitcher, got
three balls on his first three pitches to Silverton,
and the Harvard man, waiting for his good one,
drove a long single out between right and centre
fields that let in Williams and Manning with scores
two and three. Two easy outs followed.</p>

<p>“Three to two!” cried Sam, joyfully. “Two
more innings!”</p>

<p>“It’s too close for comfort yet,” said Duncan,
nervously. “I’d give a month’s allowance to
see the game end now. That’s Coy up, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>But Coy swung three times in vain at his old
pitcher’s curves. One of his successors reached
first, but two others went out and left him there.
The Harvard men fared no better.</p>

<p>“Three more outs. It ought to be dead easy,”
muttered Sam, as the ninth began. The first
Yale man at the bat drove a ball into left field
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
that looked good for two bases. But Latter
got in front of it and sent it in to second in season
to scare the runner back to first. A big bony
chap followed at the plate.</p>

<p>“That’s Kleindienst. He used to play with
Hillbury. He can hit. They’re going to do us
right here. I feel it in my bones.” Duncan
jerked out his words in curt explosives. “There!
he’s done it!” he groaned, as the batsman drove
the ball in a long sweep over third base.</p>

<p>“No, it struck outside the foul line!” cried
Sam, eagerly, as the applause on the Yale side
died suddenly away. “See! he’s gone back to
the plate!”</p>

<p>“And got a strike for it, too,” said the reviving
Duncan. “That’s where the foul strike rule hits
’em.”</p>

<p>While he spoke O’Brien sent in another pitch.
Kleindienst hit another foul. This time the ball
careened over towards the stands opposite first
base. Owen tipped off his mask and ran headlong
in pursuit. He took the descending ball with
hands outstretched; and while the howl of applause
was yet at its beginning, he turned sharply
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
and threw to first base. The Yale man scrambled
wildly back, but the ball was there before him.
Williams fielded the next man out at first.</p>

<p>“Come on! Let’s find him!” sang out Duncan,
and dashed down the aisle before the rising crowd
got under way. Sam followed. They rushed
out into the field and made for the close circle
gathering rapidly round the catcher.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait for you,” said Sam. “He won’t
care anything about me.”</p>

<p>“Won’t he!” cried Duncan. “Come and see!”
And dragging Sam along behind him, he screwed
his way into the cluster at the centre of which
Owen was fighting off the vehement attentions
of admirers. At the sight of Duncan he broke
through the circle and pulled the boy in.</p>

<p>“Duncan Peck! I was wondering whether
you were here. Didn’t we have luck! Glad to
see you, Archer. How are things at Seaton?”</p>

<p>But before the question could be answered, the
questioner was rushed in another direction, and
Sam and Duncan found themselves whirled to the
outside of the circle.</p>

<p>Sam looked at his watch. “There’s just forty-five
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
minutes before the train leaves. We’ve
got to hustle to catch it! We promised to take
it, you know.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we did,” sighed Duncan. “I hate
to leave now. I haven’t seen Don at all. Go
ahead!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br />

<span class="medium">JUNE TO DECEMBER</span></h2>

<p>It was well for our young men that they could
share Owen’s victory, for Patterson, their school
captain, gave them none of their own to enjoy.
A pitcher cannot win a game alone; and Patterson’s
cleverness availed only to keep the Hillbury
score down; his followers balked his efforts with
errors, and only O’Toole hit the Hillbury pitcher
with any readiness.</p>

<p>After the Hillbury game, Sam focused his
interest on the college examinations. Mr. Alsop
had at the last moment, with much misgiving,
granted him a provisional recommendation in
French; and Sam, eager no less to vindicate
himself than to get rid of the troublesome subject,
hammered away at it during the last few weeks
with a determination worthy of a great cause.
He was sure of his history and mathematics, and
reasonably confident in Greek and Latin; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
English, the crank-ridden, and French, the elusively
easy, mocked him with promise of failure.</p>

<p>Duncan likewise yielded himself to the spirit
of industry which was turning 7 Hale into the
workshop of scholastic cyclops. The latch was
kept down perpetually during these days of preparation.
Only Duncan’s tutor, the useful Moorhead,
and occasionally the irresistible Bruce
found entrance. Duncan was at last serious;
actually confronted by the alternative of passing
certain examinations and going to Harvard, or
failing and going to work, he understood that the
time for trifling was past. It is safe to say that
Sam Archer’s example and encouragement, and
Moorhead’s patient readiness to explain and help,
were of more use to Duncan in his weary battle
than class instruction or tutor’s drill.</p>

<p>Duncan did pass his examinations,&mdash;he fell
sprawling, but across the line,&mdash;and Archer got
every point he had worked for. He missed an
honor which he had hoped to get, but he triumphed
in Mr. Alsop’s subject with a C, which, boy-like,
he regarded as a decision awarded him against
the teacher’s doubts, not as a proof of good instruction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
There followed for Sam an untroubled
summer of loafing and tennis, rowing and sailing;
of reckless squandering of time on pure play;
of reading books that were not required and
dreaming dreams of triumphs that would never
come to pass. He took back with him to school
greater physical vigor and clearer comprehension
of his own personal problem.</p>

<p>Sam settled with Moorhead very comfortably
in his old room, and entered upon the tasks of his
senior year with the quiet purpose of making it
count. To accomplish this, he understood vaguely
but sufficiently that he must keep himself, physically
and morally, under good control, must work
steadily rather than frantically, and pursue a
sane ambition. This sane ambition, so far as
athletics were concerned, lay along the hurdle
path. Unless some phenomenon unexpectedly
appeared, he could reasonably count on becoming
the school champion in the high hurdles. To be
school champion, however, was but a half-success.
The Seatonian grudges honor to a man who leads
merely because there happens to be no one better.
The Seaton champion must prevail over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
champions of other schools, if he is to have the
credit of achievement.</p>

<p>Sam knew this quite as well as any one else;
he appreciated its personal bearing as no one else
could. In the background of every picture called
up by a hopeful imagination, hovered the figure
of Kilham of Hillbury. Wherever Sam foresaw
a chance of distinction, there was Kilham to contest
it with him. At the winter competition in
Boston, at the interscholastic games, in the Hillbury-Seaton
dual meet, he must struggle against
this quick-starting, strong-running rival, who was
at least half a second better on the high-hurdle
course. Should he ever be able to beat that
fellow? Sam considered his own vain endeavors
to put speed into his long legs, and confessed
frankly that the odds were heavy against him.
But none the less, being of the smilingly persistent
kind, he went on with his practice undaunted, as if
he had battles to win instead of to lose. He also
gave close attention to his school work. Birdie
Fowle informed him one day that he was no good
any more; Moorhead had made a grind out of
him. Sam’s laughing comment was that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
wanted to get into college decently if possible,
with a point or two to the good. This was true,
but it was not the fundamental reason for his
devotion to his studies.</p>

<p>During the summer Archer had run across a
Hillburyite named Denton, at the seashore.
When he inquired of this Hillburyite what kind
of a fellow Kilham was, Denton declared him the
very finest sort of a fellow. Later Sam chanced
to ask how Kilham did in his studies, and Denton
returned a report distinctly favorable; he was not
the very best, of course, but much better than the
average. Sam considered these facts a full week.
At the end of that time he had made up his mind
that if he had to run second to Kilham in the
hurdles, he wouldn’t fall behind in the classroom,
too. This secretly nourished ambition to maintain
a rank that he need not be ashamed to have
compared with that of his Hillbury rival, increased
rather than diminished as the year slipped away.
Certain teachers who grew from month to month
more complacent over their stimulating influence
on Archer, would have been much surprised to
learn that the steady up trend of his rank line was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
due to an unacknowledged, unreal competition
with a student in another school.</p>

<p>Sam’s fall hurdle practice was interrupted by
the summons to class football. Before the season
was far advanced, the captain of the senior team
was promoted to the first eleven squad, and Sam
was chosen captain in his place. With the care
of his eleven and the class games and the duty
of punting to practise the school backs, Sam
found small opportunity to play with his pair
of hurdles.</p>

<p>The season was a fortunate one for the school
eleven, and still more fortunate for Mulcahy,
who stepped in mid-season into the shoes of a
big tackle who had ignominiously succumbed
to the measles; and he kept his place through
half the Hillbury game. He was thus a member
of a victorious school eleven, in a position to reap
the glory of the successful efforts of others. As
a matter of fact, the game was won by Kendrick,
or by Kendrick and Illerton, the new end, together,
after the line had been ignobly crowded to and
fro, up and down the field, for three quarters
of the playing time. But a victory is a victory,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
and Mulcahy retained his good share of the prestige
which the members of a winning team enjoy.</p>

<p>He made immediate use of this prestige to
attain a long-cherished ambition. In the fall
of the previous year, and again in the spring, he
had been balked in his efforts to become president
of the Laurel Leaf, largely through the influence
of Duncan Peck and his following. Duncan
Peck was now gone and many new fellows had
come. This time Mulcahy adopted less open
methods of soliciting. Swan was his manager,
a natural politician who loved the excitement
of a campaign. Swan cared nothing about
Mulcahy, but was down on Archer, who had
scorned an invitation to join the Mu Nu, Swan’s
fraternity, which ranked as the “yaller dog” of
school societies. Sam and Moorhead tried to
persuade Kendrick to run for the Leaf, and
failed. Then they fell back on Blankenberg,
a substitute on the eleven, who possessed solid
qualities and would have filled the office with
dignity. Then it was that Swan whisked into
the field to the support of the candidate whom
Archer opposed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span></p>

<p>The contest was uneven. On the one side
Mulcahy, football player, editor of the “Seatonian,”
ready-tongued, of imposing personality,
offering a fine show, both of talent and of school
spirit; on the other Blankenberg, plain, honest,
conscientious, modest. Mulcahy triumphed with
votes to throw away. He came over to Blankenberg
after the affair was over with a very pretty
display of personal sympathy.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you didn’t get it, really I am,” he
said. “I shouldn’t take it if so many hadn’t
voted for me.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you won, if the majority want you,”
returned Blankenberg, honestly.</p>

<p>“I think your manager lost you votes,” Mulcahy
went on, pretending to joke, but avoiding
Sam’s eye. “I wouldn’t trust him again.”</p>

<p>Blankenberg and Sam walked out together.
“Isn’t he the limit,” exploded Sam, when they
were alone, “for pulling the wool over people’s
eyes! He’s got everybody on the string from
the faculty to Dunbar Hall, and he hasn’t a
principle to his name. The school’s training
that fellow for a political boss.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p>“He didn’t need to be unprincipled to win
to-night,” remarked Blankenberg. “It was too
easy. I rather think he’ll find some way of
getting ’most anything he wants.”</p>

<p>Sam struggled with an impulse to quote Mulcahy’s
statement that his supreme ambition was
to win the Yale Cup; but the feeling that Mulcahy
had spoken in confidence prevented his mention
of it. It seemed quite reasonable now that this
ambition should be attained.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing he can’t get,” he said with
pardonable bitterness, “class day offices. The
class knows him too well.”</p>

<p>But therein Sam was mistaken. The Omega
Omicron clashed with the Alpha Beta Gamma
over the election of President of the Day, neither
being willing to give in to the other. As a result,
the unfraternified, moulded into a temporarily
coherent force through the influence of the
vengeful Swan and the despised Mu Nu, united
on Mulcahy and swept him into office.</p>

<p>“There seems to be nothing that that fellow
can’t rake in if he tries,” Sam grumbled to himself,
as he swung moodily homeward from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
class election. “Of course you’d expect the faculty
to be fooled, but here’s half the class voting
for him when nine out of every ten know he’s
a rotten fakir. Think of our bringing all our
relatives to class day, and that fellow sitting up
on the platform as the representative man of the
graduating class of Seaton Academy! The Yale
Cup?&mdash;Mulcahy, of course! Anything he wants.
He’s our color-bearer, sure enough! Rah, rah,
rah, Mulcahy!”

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<span class="medium">JANUARY TO MAY</span></h2>

<p>The hurrying weeks brought Sam once more
face to face with his rival of Hillbury. Again
one of thirty-odd numbers, he mingled with the
confused throng of candidates near the starting
line of the forty-yard hurdles in Mechanics’
Hall.</p>

<p>“Who’s that fellow with the blue stripes across
his shirt?” asked a boy at his elbow, who wore
the colors of a Boston school.</p>

<p>Sam gave his benighted neighbor a sharp glance
of surprise. “That’s Kilham of Hillbury!”</p>

<p>“Any good?”</p>

<p>“Good enough to beat me!” returned Sam.</p>

<p>“I guess it lies between Sage of Worcester and
Doane of Noble’s,” said the lad.</p>

<p>Sam smiled grimly. He knew that it lay
between Kilham of Hillbury and&mdash;somebody
else.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

<p>The first heat was run: Kilham led at the tape;
Sage of Worcester fell out. In the second heat
Number Eighteen was at the fore,&mdash;the programme
showed Number Eighteen to be Archer
of Seaton. The third went to Doane of Noble’s;
the fourth to Jessop of Boston Latin; the fifth&mdash;but
why detail the process of sifting? The
final heat was called. In it stood Kilham, Archer,
Doane, Whelan of the Boston High, and a nameless
white shirt from a small school, who by luck
and good natural ability had squeezed through
the early heats.</p>

<p>Kilham gave Sam a nod of recognition.
“We’ve been up against each other before.”</p>

<p>Sam smiled assent. “Twice.”</p>

<p>“And shall be again, probably. Don’t let
those small school fellows beat us, anyway. If
I can’t win, I hope you will.”</p>

<p>“The same to you,” answered Sam; but his
voice was lost in the starter’s call.</p>

<p>On the “set” Doane tried to beat the starter,
and was put back a foot. All hung well on the
next trial, and the pistol shot sent them away.
Doane flashed into the front rank at the outset,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
but he was clumsy on the second hurdle and lost
his advantage. Kilham and Archer rose from
the start together. Kilham reached the first
hurdle a foot ahead, but Archer gained on the
hurdle jump. It was the same on the second.
At the third hurdle, four runners seemed to
sweep the air abreast, but Doane and Whelan
lost a fraction of a second in clearing, and fell a
foot behind Kilham and Archer. On the final
stretch the Hillbury man drove himself to the
front. Sam strained at his sluggish muscles
with every power of nerve and brain, but Kilham
was the faster. Sam’s frantic efforts, though
insufficient to carry him past Kilham, at least
enabled him to hold a place ahead of his pursuers.
He crossed the line second, adjudged
to have the better of Whelan by a few inches.</p>

<p>“What do you honestly think, Collins?” demanded
Sam, as the two talked over the day’s
happenings on the train that evening. “Shall
I ever be able to beat that fellow, or is he going
to do me right along for the next four years?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” returned Collins, frankly.
“Kilham’s a mighty good hurdler for a schoolboy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
but he isn’t the best there ever was. I’ve seen
him weaken a good bit on the last thirty yards
of the one-twenty. You’re about even on starting,
and he’s faster, but you’ve got the staying
power. It’ll depend on how you learn to take
the hurdles. You wouldn’t have the ghost of a
show on the low ones, but on the high&mdash;well,
I’ve seen a lot of good men beaten on the last
twenty yards of the high hurdles.”</p>

<p>Such was the dubious form which Collins’s
encouragement took. Collins believed thoroughly
in the efficacy of work; he was also convinced
that Archer was slowly “coming,” but he was
not one to raise false hopes.</p>

<p>“Then you really think I can improve on the
hurdle work?” pursued Sam.</p>

<p>“Of course. You jump too high, and that
first stride when you come down is too long.
You bring your outer foot around well, but it
goes out too far. You ought to better that a
good bit in the spring practice.”</p>

<p>Whatever Collins may have expected from the
spring training, he had no reason to complain
of Sam’s diligence. The average boy will work
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
with great zeal for the first and last weeks of his
preparation for an important contest. He usually
starts with enthusiasm, allows his ardor to
ebb under the tiresome monotony of the daily
drudgery, and warms to his work again as the
crisis approaches. And not infrequently does
it happen that the loss by this middle period of
neglect proves so serious that the candidate drops
out discouraged before the test arrives. It was
one of Collins’s strong points as a trainer that
he tried to carry his charges all the way. He
did not trust all reports or accept every excuse.
He strove to know what his boys were doing,
how they were spending their time, what they
ate and drank, where they went. He made no
apologies for searching closely into the lives
which the boys were leading. Unless they lived
properly, played honorably, worked faithfully,
he would have none of them.</p>

<p>If Collins had possessed a magic wand by the
touch of which slow muscles could be endowed
with marvellous speed, he certainly would have
given Archer the benefit of the first application
of it. Sam took the privations of training, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
well as the regular drill, as parts of his normal
day. While he longed to win, and still dreamed
of the happy moment when he should show his
back to Kilham on the hurdle path, he could
laugh good-naturedly at his ambitions, and speak
frankly of the likelihood of failure. He did not
worry and did not lose courage. He played
tennis, enjoyed his friends, did his school work
as well as he could, got good hours of rest, shunned
the things that weaken,&mdash;and grew hard of
muscle and sound of wind, living his life with
happiness and zest.</p>

<p>Toward the end of May he was sent with a
batch of Seatonians to take part in the inter-scholastics
in Cambridge. In the final of the
one-twenty hurdles, he fell in once more with
Kilham and Doane of Noble’s.</p>

<p>“Hello, Archer!” called Kilham, cheerily. “We
meet again. It’s your turn to-day.”</p>

<p>“I wish it was,” said Sam.</p>

<p>But luck turned against him. The starter
held them a long time on the set, and Sam fell
over before the trigger was pulled. He was put
back a yard. On the next attempt he erred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
through overcaution, and lost another yard on
the start. Always slow in getting into his stride,
he saw his two rivals dash well ahead of him for
the first two hurdles. As Sam was topping the
third, Kilham and Doane were close to the fourth.
Hopeless though the race seemed, he pressed on,
taking his jumps in his best form, driving himself
in the inter-hurdles paces, as if each were the finish
of the race. And lo! he gained! With every
hurdle he drew up on the leading pair. At the
eighth he was at Doane’s heels. The tenth he
crossed abreast of the second man and beat him
out through greater strength in the final dash for
the line,&mdash;but Kilham as usual was first, this
time by only two feet.</p>

<p>For a time Sam was disheartened. When he
compared the two feet advantage which Kilham
had over him at the finish with the two yards lost
at the start, and realized that he had plenty of
reserve force on the last stretch while Kilham
was running weak, he felt that fate was indeed
against him. But Collins soon got hold of him
and altered the hue of his thoughts. He had
never before been put back in a race; it wouldn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
happen again; he had run a yard farther than
the victor and finished but two feet behind him.
He would have another chance at the Hillbury
meet; let him but keep up his courage and work
hard, and he would win out yet!</p>

<p>Yes, keep up your courage and work! That
had been Collins’s song these two years. But
what availed courage and work against fate and
a better man?</p>

<p>“He’ll probably beat me,” thought Sam, as the
day of the Hillbury meet approached; “he’ll
probably beat me, for he always has beaten me,
but I’ll run him harder than I’ve ever done before!”</p>

<p>On the day before the meet, Sam dropped in at
the Sedgwicks’ to offer two tickets to the games,
which his father had written that he could not
use. Margaret clapped her hands with delight
at the prospect. “We must go, mother, and
see Sam win. It’s our last chance. Do go!”</p>

<p>“It’s my last chance, all right,” said Sam,
“but don’t go expecting me to win. I always lose.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to win, if we go. And we are
going, aren’t we, mother?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>“We’ll see,” answered the cautious mother.
“Sam had better stay to dinner and talk it over
with your father.”</p>

<p>“Invite me next week, and I’ll come with joy,”
answered Sam, ruefully. “You have too many
good things to eat for a fellow in training.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sedgwick and Margaret were on the Seaton
special that carried the school to Hillbury. Sam
sat in the seat opposite them, and for the time
enjoyed complete relief from anxious thoughts of
the contest. They parted at the station, when
Sam went forward to join the other members of
the team in the barge that was awaiting them.</p>

<p>“You must show me your gold medal when
we go back,” said the girl, gayly, as she bade him
good luck. “You know we’ve come on purpose
to help you win it.” Sam lifted his cap and ran
smilingly away to quiet the barge-load of impatients
who were clamoring for Archer to quit his
“fussing” and get aboard. Miss Margaret’s blind
confidence had driven Sam’s fatalism to cover.
Could it be his day after all?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<span class="medium">ARCHER <i>versus</i> KILHAM</span></h2>

<p>It was clear, two events before the high hurdles
came, that Hillbury was to win the day. In
four races Seaton had been beaten by feet and
inches in desperate finishes. It may have been
luck that the leaders in these four contests were
Hillbury men; luck certainly had nothing to do
with the fact that in each of the four the third
prize went to a wearer of the blue. Kilham
had taken the two-twenty hurdles; Hillbury with
Kilham in the lead had swept every place in the
broad jump. Mulcahy could crawl no higher than
third in the pole vault. Collins took the issue
philosophically, as a man might well do who had
toiled early and late to work second-class material
into a first-class product, and who, incidentally,
had accomplished more than any three members
of the faculty toward establishing throughout
the school a standard of right living and honest
striving.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

<p>But stoically as Collins took the issues of fate,
his real feelings broke through the mask of calmness
when the one-twenty hurdles were called,
and Sam and Pearson, wearing Seaton colors,
took the places assigned them and dug their
starting holes. Defeat may have its consolations;
and to Collins no consolation could be
quite so satisfactory as a victory for his long-legged
pupil, who had done his work month in
and month out like a man of years and responsibilities,
and had come up smiling after every
knockdown, with determination unquenched.
Miss Margaret, on the Seaton benches near the
finish line, strained her eyes to see the starting,
oblivious to the fact that her pulse was beating
ten counts faster than it had any right to. Sam
himself, having something definite to do, and
something definite to think of, was less agitated
than Miss Margaret, or even Collins. The something
definite to think of was the uncommon
solidity of the Hillbury hurdles. If he struck
one, it would throw him&mdash;or at least so he feared.
He must be sure to clear, even at the waste of a
few inches; and unnecessary inches in the rise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
meant, he knew full well, a fraction of a second
in total loss. On the full extent of this handicap
he did not dwell. It was enough that he must
keep well above the hurdles.</p>

<p>The start was even&mdash;at least for Kilham and
Archer. They sprang for the first hurdle in step
together, like well-matched horses. Sam’s leap
was needlessly high; Kilham gained thereby a
small advantage, which he increased to a yard as
the third hurdle was passed. Then Sam, becoming
less fearful of the rise, brought his jump down
nearer the top of the hurdle and began to regain
lost ground. On the fifth they were together
again. After that Sam forged ahead, clearing
every obstacle just in front of his rival. As he
struck the ground after the tenth he realized that
his hopes depended on his holding his advantage
against a faster sprinter for a distance of less than
fifteen yards. He had been running at full tension
throughout the race; he could do no better now.</p>

<p>As the runners swept past the seats where sat
Mrs. Sedgwick and Margaret, the girl uttered a
trembling scream of joy which was drowned in the
disorderly cries of the Seaton followers. Archer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
was ahead! The blue hurled shouts of encouragement
at their struggling champion, who tore along
after his rival. Seaton yelled congratulations
and encouragement, and Hillbury encouragement
and congratulations, for Kilham did close up on
Archer. The Seatonians thought they had it,
and then feared that they had lost it; while
the Hillburyites feared loss, and later exulted in
the thought that they had won. It all happened
in the shortest possible time, and at first nobody
knew the result, not even the judges. Collins,
who stood on a line with the finish, said it was
very close, but it looked like Archer; Bruce
declared that it was Archer by six inches; the
Hillburyites capered about, shouting that Kilham
had it by a foot. One judge said Archer; the
second Kilham; the other wasn’t sure. Kilham
ran off to his rub-down straightway; Sam lingered,
panting on Collins’s shoulder, to hear the decision.
Of course it was not for him to judge the race,
but he had felt the worsted thread tighten against
his breast, and he knew that a beaten man never
brushes the finish cord.</p>

<p>The judges conferred and reported to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
announcer, who bellowed forth the news: a tie!
Whereat all hands applauded, except the special
friends of either contestant, who agreed in considering
it “a steal,” but disagreed as to the
party whose rights had been stolen. Sam’s first
emotion was one of grievous disappointment.
Kilham had beaten him often&mdash;but this time!
After all, it might have been worse. The judges
might have given the first place to Kilham, and
adjudged him second. Judges are but mortal.
The thought of the fate escaped comforted him
in a measure for the disappointment. At any
rate, he was not a loser. He had won the race
as much as Kilham had.</p>

<p>An official appeared with the medals in his
hand, pretty shining things, one gold, the other
silver, bedded on heavy ribbons marked with
the colors of the two schools.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to toss for these,” he said in a
businesslike way. “Where’s the other fellow?”</p>

<p>The other fellow had disappeared. Richmond
Noyes, the Hillbury baseball captain, pushed
forward. “Kilham’s gone to get his rub-down,”
he said. “I’ll toss for him.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

<p>The official hesitated a moment as if uncertain
as to the propriety of the substitution, but a
colleague reassured him. “All right! You call,
Archer!” he said, and his practised hand sent a
coin spinning in the air.</p>

<p>“Tails!” cried Sam, who had drawn an induction
from several experiences that tails were
luckier for him than heads.</p>

<p>The official stooped and picked up the coin.
“Heads it is!” he announced cheerfully.</p>

<p>Noyes clutched the gold medal and scurried
away in quest of Kilham. Sam took his portion
of the spoil, and dodging alike compliments and
condolences, went his leisurely way toward the
Seaton quarters. Could anything be more symbolic
than that toss! When after two years of
uphill work he was at last wholly ready to meet
Kilham in a square, even race, those heavy, clumsy
hurdles had to turn up and lose him three or four
feet; of course! Kilham, actually beaten by some
inches, was considered by the wall-eyed judges
to have led; of course! With equal chance to
draw the gold medal, he must needs get the silver;
of course! Did ever any one have such luck!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p>“Archer! Oh, Archer! Hold on!”</p>

<p>Sam turned in the direction of the unfamiliar
voice and beheld trotting toward him a bareheaded
youth, whose chief article of attire was a
bath robe. Behind the bath robe strode Noyes,
his blue-ribboned hat tilted back on his head, wearing
upon his face an expression of desperate disgust.</p>

<p>“Look here, Archer,” began Kilham, eagerly,
while still a dozen feet away, “I don’t want this
thing. It belongs to you.”</p>

<p>The “thing” in question was the gold medal,
which Noyes had carried off in a burst of delight
but a few minutes before. “Give me the other
one and take this,” Kilham went on, holding out
the first prize to the astonished Seatonian.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Sam, blankly.</p>

<p>“Because I won’t take it, because it doesn’t
belong to me, because Rich here had no business
to butt in and get it. I didn’t want to toss for
the thing.”</p>

<p>A look of eager joy flashed into Sam’s face, only
to fade away again as the character of the offer
which Kilham was making came home to him.
It was generous of Kilham, who had lots of prizes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
to refuse to deprive his rival of the only good one
which he had ever won. It was a fine thing to
do; but Sam could not profit by the pitying generosity
of a kind-hearted rival.</p>

<p>“It didn’t make any difference who tossed for
it,” said Sam. “We accepted Noyes as your
representative. The judges gave the race a tie,
and we tossed for prizes. That settled it.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t settle anything,” returned Kilham,
warmly. “Noyes had no more authority to toss
for me than that kid there. I didn’t win the race
and I’m not going to take the prize. You won
the race. I almost got you at the finish, but not
quite. You touched that thread before I did.
I’m sure of it.”</p>

<p>Sam stared and pondered. “The judges declared
it a tie,” he said at length.</p>

<p>“Then it will have to be a tie so far as the
official record goes. We can’t dispute the judges,
but we can divide the prizes as they ought to be
divided. I won the second prize. I’ll have that
or none!”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll take the gold one,” decided Sam, in a
subdued voice. When the exchange was effected,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
he held out his hand to his old rival, who seemed
to him at that moment more unreachable than
ever, and blurted out, “If there are many fellows
like you in Hillbury, I wish I had gone there!”</p>

<p>So it happened that Sam Archer really did have
a gold medal to show Miss Margaret when he
met her again at the train, and with it a little
tale to tell of schoolboy honesty and generosity.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<span class="medium">THE YALE CUP</span></h2>

<p>With the passing of the Hillbury meet, Archer’s
career as a school athlete was at an end. He
played tennis and scrub ball, but this was play,
not work. His training now was for quite another
kind of contest&mdash;the final wrestling match
with the college examinations. He shared as a
helpless onlooker in the disaster of the annual
ball game, when Noyes’s nine after a hard fight
took the Seatonians into camp. The football
men were the only victors of the year, since even
in tennis honors were divided. Sam smiled to
himself somewhat grimly as he considered how
fortune had cooperated with Mulcahy in his
ambitions for the Yale Cup. Against the background
of defeated teams, the football men bulked
large as athletes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Archer came up to be present at the festivities
of graduation week. With Mrs. Sedgwick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
and Margaret, she started early for the chapel
exercises with which the school year formally
closed. As they crossed the yard, the seniors were
forming in a long, uneven double line that extended
from the steps of the main school building
across the lawn toward the outer fence.
Late risers were scurrying from the dormitories,
struggling, on the run, to work their arms into
the sleeves of their gowns and at the same time
to keep their mortar-boards safely balanced on
their heads. The marshals were zealously and
more or less effectually ordering the jeering
battalion. Sam, looking like a giant in the ample
gown that covered his bony length, raised his
cap over a face glowing with satisfaction as the
three visitors passed the head of the line, hurrying
to reach their places before the procession took
the right of way. “He’s a dear boy,” thought the
mother with pride, “if he is not a genius. He does
the best he can.”</p>

<p>They were given seats on the side aisle, well to
the front; the middle section was reserved for
the class. Before the platform stood a heavy
table. On it were the score of prizes to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
assigned, piles of books, impressive envelopes
containing the money awarded, and in the midst,
towering in cold stateliness above two minor
brethren, the shining form of the Yale Cup.
Solemn faces of benefactors and famous graduates
looked down disapprovingly from the walls;
there had been no such lavish display of prizes
in the simple old days when they were members
of the school, reciting Latin and Greek by candlelight
to austere, dignified gentlemen who revered
Cicero as the model for all language and ignored
French and German as the lingo of dancing-masters
and fiddlers. Flanking the platform
and facing the audience, ran a long line of chairs&mdash;“for
the faculty,” whispered Mrs. Sedgwick,
who had been present on such occasions before.</p>

<p>Presently the tramp of feet was heard, and the
seniors filed in for their last chapel service. They
stood, when they reached their places, waiting for
the dignitaries, who were not slow to appear.
The principal entered with the president of the
board of trustees, two clergymen from abroad,
others of the trustees who were in town, and a
venerable alumnus or two to whom the school
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
would do honor. These took places on the platform,
in the alcove behind the reading desk.
After them came the faculty, a motley line, in
which staid elderly men, of the wisdom which is
born of long intercourse with boys, touched
shoulders with youths fresh from the university&mdash;in
whom self-confidence and zeal must still do
duty for ripe experience and sound judgment.
When all were placed, the visiting clergymen
conducted the simple devotional exercises, the
hymns rolling with resonant vigor from two
hundred masculine throats. Then the president
of the board of trustees, encumbered by many
typewritten sheets, came forward beside the desk
for the formal business of the day.</p>

<p>He began by addressing certain neatly worded
compliments to the graduating class. In this
task, which was in the line of his daily work as
an advocate before important courts, he acquitted
himself with dignity and impressiveness. When,
however, he came to the reading of the list of
those entitled to diplomas, his experience in
public speaking availed him little. He waded
on, undaunted, through fourscore names, pronounceable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
and unpronounceable, drawn from
all races and all lands. As each name was
read or attempted, its claimant rose in response,
until every wearer of a gown was on his feet.
Then the diplomas were passed out in bunches
to chosen delegates, who delivered them to their
proper owners.</p>

<p>With a feeling of relief the president laid aside
the catalogue of seniors, and took up the short
list of honor men. After this he passed to those
of the school who had earned “honorable mention,”
finding new pitfalls in untried combinations
of letters which stood for certain deserving members
of lower classes. With the next sheet began
the announcement of prize-winners.</p>

<p>Here was the climax of the day. Many were
the boys who listened with quick-beating hearts,
hoping to hear the sound of their names; and
many there were who listened in vain. The
president announced the prize and the award;
the secretary of the faculty took the prize from
the table and handed it to the principal; the principal
delivered it into the hands of its owner.
As one and another came forward, flushed with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
happy embarrassment, and received the reward
of his labor, the school gave abundant applause,
those who had nourished no hopes and those
who had hoped in vain uniting in generous congratulation
of the victors. So went the Latin
prizes, the Greek prizes, the prizes in English
composition, in Mathematics, in Bible study, in
History; the prize for general excellence in studies
and that for physical development. Sam’s interest
was keen in the result, for he hoped to see
his room-mate honored as a Latinist. He chuckled
with delight as Moorhead was called a second
time to the gift table, and brought back a sample
from the pile of twelve large volumes of Shakespeare
as a prize in English.</p>

<p>There were but three or four awards still to be
made when Sam, seeing the secretary reach for
the big three-handled cup that mounted guard over
the remaining envelopes and books, knew that the
time for Mulcahy’s prize had come. He glanced
backward curiously over his shoulder at the astute
strategist who sat a few seats away, and marked
with amused interest the artful mask of indifference
which the young man wore. So fascinating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
was this study of Mulcahy the expectant, and
Mulcahy the ready-to-be-surprised, that Sam
very impolitely kept his eyes on the face in the
row behind until the president had finished the
long description: “The Yale Cup, given by the
Yale Club of Boston to the Senior who best
combines proficiency in athletics with good
standing in his studies.” As the reader paused,
Sam faced front and prepared to applaud the
name of John Joseph Mulcahy,&mdash;but the name
the president read was “Samuel Wadsworth
Archer”!</p>

<p>The applause thundered forth sudden and
sharp, no perfunctory service of courtesy, but a
burst of enthusiastic approval that swept the
whole student company. It rose and fell and
rose again, vehement and long drawn out. The
boys in front twisted their heads around as they
strove, still beating their palms, to catch a glimpse
of the winner; those in the seats behind craned
their necks with the same laudable design. And
Sam sat with downcast eyes and glowing cheeks,
hearing but not believing, stupidly delaying the
exercises, yet hardly daring to answer the summons;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
until Westbrook, who sat beside him,
stopped clapping long enough to dig him in the
ribs with a sharp elbow and enjoin him: “Go and
get it, you fool. Don’t you see you’re keeping
the whole business waiting?” To this exhortation
Sam gave heed.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the exercises Sam sat
with the precious cup clutched beneath his gown,
ecstatically demanding of himself again and
again how it could possibly be, and pitying the
unfortunate whose deep-laid plans had gone so
wholly wrong. When the audience was dismissed,
he was at once overwhelmed by boys who insisted
on shaking his hand and slapping his shoulder
and telling him that the award was “just right,”&mdash;and,
of course, handling the cup.</p>

<p>Mrs. Archer, on her side, was a general target
for congratulations. She received them with
the composure of a mother who is never wholly
surprised at any honor bestowed upon her son;
but in her eyes burned a light of happiness and
excitement that belied her quiet manner, and her
gaze would wander to the group of gowns that
thronged her tall son and hid the white gleam
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
of silver from the sight of the unprivileged
curious.</p>

<p>“How did he happen to get it?” she asked
Dr. Leighton, as the teacher came to offer his
compliments. “I’m sure he hadn’t the slightest
expectation of its coming to him.”</p>

<p>“Of course he didn’t expect it,” returned
Dr. Leighton. “The boy who deserves such a
prize rarely expects it. I can tell you how it
came to be awarded to him, because I was on
the committee. He won it by good honest
work. It was what he accomplished, not what
he chanced to do, that turned the scales in his
favor.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Archer’s look indicated that she was not
quite sure that she understood; but before she
could ask further, her son broke through the circle
of students, and came, sheepishly dangling the cup
by one of its heavy handles, to greet his mother.
Sam was not sufficiently experienced in prize-winning
to take his honors easily, especially
when Margaret Sedgwick roguishly assumed a
clean record of A’s as a part of his title to the
cup, and insisted on knowing all details. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
managed to escape these embarrassing attentions
by calling up Moorhead and presenting him as the
banner prize-catcher of the class; and presently,
on the pretext of helping his room-mate carry
home his load of Shakespeares, he succeeded in
getting safely away.</p>

<p>The next morning when Sam called at the
Sedgwicks’ to see his mother, he found her on the
garden piazza, with a Boston paper on her lap.</p>

<p>“There’s a whole column here about the
Commencement,” she said, as Sam sat down beside
her. “Don’t you want to see it?”</p>

<p>Sam laughed contentedly. “I don’t need to
read about it; I was there.”</p>

<p>“And beside it is a report from the Hillbury
Commencement, too. Prizes aren’t so plenty in
Hillbury. There seem to be hardly half as many
as are given here.”</p>

<p>The prizes at Hillbury possessed small interest
for Sam. He was satisfied to lounge quietly in
the comfortable chair, let his eyes wander over
the profusion of gay flowers in the old-fashioned
garden, and gloat in silence on the fact that school
recitations were, for him, forever finished. All
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
at once he straightened up in his chair and demanded:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Who got the Yale Cup down there? I wonder
if it’s any one I know?”</p>

<p>“In Hillbury?” answered Mrs. Archer, taking
up the paper again. “Let me see&mdash;the Orton
prize, the Harper prize, the&mdash;oh, yes, the Yale
Cup: Winthrop Joy Kilham.”</p>

<p>“Kilham!” cried Sam, in a sudden accession of
spirit. “Kilham! That’s great! The judges hit
the bull’s-eye that time, for sure!”</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
